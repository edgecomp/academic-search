0,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,In situ depth maps based feature extraction and tracking,"Parallel numerical simulation is a powerful tool used by scientists to study complex problems. It has been a common practice to save the simulation output to disk and then conduct post-hoc in-depth analyses of the saved data. System I/O capabilities have not kept pace as simulations have scaled up over time, so a common approach has been to output only subsets of the data to reduce I/O. However, as we are entering the era of peta-and exa-scale computing, this sub-sampling approach is no longer acceptable because too much valuable information is lost. In situ visualization has been shown a promising approach to the data problem at extreme-scale. We present a novel in situ solution using depth maps to enable post-hoc image-based visualization and feature extraction and tracking. An interactive interface is provided to allow for fine-tuning the generation of depth maps during the course of a simulation run to better capture the features of interest. We use several applications including one actual simulation run on a Cray XE6 supercomputer to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2015 IEEE."
1,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Tracking features in embedded surfaces: Understanding extinction in turbulent combustion,"Understanding the temporal evolution of features of interest requires the ability to: (i) extract features from each snapshot; (ii) correlate them over time; and (iii) understand the resulting tracking graph. This paper provides new solutions for the last two challenges in the context of large-scale turbulent combustion simulations. In particular, we present a simple and general algorithm to correlate hierarchical features, embedded in time-dependent surfaces. This, for the first time, provides a parameter independent approach to track embedded features. Furthermore, we provide a new technique to adaptively change feature parameters over time to both: alleviate artifacts due to insufficient temporal resolution as well as to simplify the resulting tracking graphs to promote new scientific insights. Our solutions are integrated into a general and flexible analysis environment that allows users to interactively explore the spatio-temporal behavior of large-scale simulations. We demonstrate the results using the analysis of extinction holes in turbulent combustion as primary case study and a number of other applications to illustrate the generality of the approach. © 2015 IEEE."
2,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Fast uncertainty-driven large-scale volume feature extraction on desktop PCs,"The ability to efficiently and accurately extract features of interest is an extremely important tool in the field of scientific visualization as it allows researchers to isolate regions based on their domain knowledge. However, the increasing size of large-scale datasets often forces users to rely on distributed computing environments which have many drawbacks in terms of interaction and convenience. Many of the current feature extraction techniques are designed around these distributed environments. The ability to overcome the memory and bandwidth limitations of desktop PCs can broaden their usability towards large-scale applications. In this work, we present a new hybrid feature extraction technique which combines GPU-accelerated clustering with the multi-resolution advantages of supervoxels in order to handle large-scale datasets on standard desktop PCs. Furthermore, this is paired with a user-driven uncertainty-based refinement approach to enhance extraction results into a desired level of detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interactivity of this technique using a number of application specific examples utilizing large-scale volumetric datasets. © 2015 IEEE."
3,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Cylindrical acceleration structures for large hexahedral volume visualization,"Scientific simulations generate large irregular volumes with complex geometry. In volume rendering, the efficiency of the ray casting algorithms relies heavily on acceleration data structures to achieve accurate visual representations at interactive rates. In this paper, two acceleration structures are introduced to visualize a large irregular volume on the GPU: (i) two-level cylindrical grid, and (ii) cylindrical bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). With thorough analysis and detailed experimental results, we demonstrate that the cylindrical data structures can effectively store the hexahedral volumes, reduce duplications, and increase ray casting performance. © 2015 IEEE."
4,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Flying edges: A high-performance scalable isocontouring algorithm,"Isocontouring remains one of the most widely used visualization techniques. While a plethora of important contouring algorithms have been developed over the last few decades, many were created prior to the advent of ubiquitous parallel computing systems. With the emergence of large data and parallel architectures, a rethinking of isocontouring and other visualization algorithms is necessary to take full advantage of modern computing hardware. To this end we have developed a high-performance isocontouring algorithm for structured data that is designed to be inherently scalable. Processing is performed completely independently along edges over multiple passes. This novel algorithm also employs computational trimming based on geometric reasoning to eliminate unnecessary computation, and removes the parallel bottleneck due to coincident point merging. As a result the algorithm performs well in serial or parallel execution, and supports heterogeneous parallel computation combining data parallel and shared memory approaches. Further it is capable of processing data too large to fit entirely inside GPU memory, does not suffer additional costs due to preprocessing and search structures, and is the fastest non-preprocessed isocontouring algorithm of which we are aware on shared memory, multi-core systems. The software is currently available under a permissive, open source licence in the VTK visualization system. © 2015 IEEE."
5,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Lagrangian representations of flow fields with parameter curves,"There are two main principles in which a flow field can be described. In its Eulerian representation, the immediate direction of the flow is used. In its Lagrangian representation, the paths of fluid parcels are stored. The latter way has proven less prone to error in cases when only a sparse subset of the original flow field can be used due to restrictions in computational capacity, which are inevitable in practice. But so far, a main drawback of the Lagrangian representation is that it leads to unsightly lines with sharp edges, because the spanning trajectories are stored as polygonal chains to minimize storage space. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing to represent the trajectories by means of parameter curves, like composite Bézier curves and cubic Hermite splines, instead of polygonal chains. We demonstrate that a parameter representation results in smoother lines with comparable approximation error under equal conditions of limited storage capacity. © 2015 IEEE."
6,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,A compact multivariate histogram representation for query-driven visualization,"As the size of data continues to increase, distribution-based methods become increasingly more important for data summarization and queries. To represent the distribution from a dataset without relying on a particular parametric model, histograms are widely used in many applications as it is simple to create and efficient to query. For multivariate scientific datasets, however, storing multivariate histograms in the form of multi-dimensional arrays is very expensive as the size of the histogram grows exponentially with the number of variables. In this paper, we present a compact structure to store multivariate histograms to reduce its huge space cost while supporting different kinds of histogram queries efficiently. A data space transformation is employed first to transform the large multi-dimensional array to a much smaller array. Dictionaries are constructed to encode this transformation. Then, the multivariate histogram is represented as a sequence of index and frequency pairs where the indices are represented as bitstrings computed from a space filling curve traversal of the transformed array. With this compact representation, the storage cost for the histograms is reduced. Based on our representation, we also present several common types of queries such as histogram marginalization, bin-merging and computation of conditional probability. We parallelize both the histogram computation and queries to improve its efficiency. We present several query-driven visualization applications to explore and analyze multivariate scientific datasets. Experimental results to study the performance of our framework in terms of scalability and space cost are also discussed. © 2015 IEEE."
7,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,A visual analytics paradigm enabling trillion-edge graph exploration,"We present a visual analytics paradigm and a system prototype for exploring web-scale graphs. A web-scale graph is described as a graph with ∼one trillion edges and ∼50 billion vertices. While there is an aggressive R&D effort in processing and exploring web-scale graphs among internet vendors such as Facebook and Google, visualizing a graph of that scale still remains an underexplored R&D area. The paper describes a nontraditional peek-and-filter strategy that facilitates the exploration of a graph database of unprecedented size for visualization and analytics. We demonstrate that our system prototype can 1) preprocess a graph with ∼25 billion edges in less than two hours and 2) support database query and interactive visualization on the processed graph database afterward. Based on our computational performance results, we argue that we most likely will achieve the one trillion edge mark (a computational performance improvement of 40 times) for graph visual analytics in the near future. © 2015 IEEE."
8,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Scalable visualization of discrete velocity decompositions using spatially organized histograms,"Visualizing the velocity decomposition of a group of objects has applications to many studied data types, such as Lagrangian-based flow data or geospatial movement data. Traditional visualization techniques are often subject to a trade-off between visual clutter and loss of detail, especially in a large scale setting. The use of 2D velocity histograms can alleviate these issues. While they have been used throughout domain specific areas on a basic level, there has been very little work in the visualization community on leveraging them to perform more advanced visualization tasks. In this work, we develop an interactive system which utilizes velocity histograms to visualize the velocity decomposition of a group of objects. In addition, we extend our tool to utilize two schemes for histogram generation: an on-the-fly sampling scheme as well as an in situ scheme to maintain interactivity in extreme scale applications. © 2015 IEEE."
9,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Exploring tradeoffs between power and performance for a scientific visualization algorithm,"Power is becoming a major design constraint in the world of high-performance computing (HPC). This constraint affects the hardware being considered for future architectures, the ways it will run software, and the design of the software itself. Within this context, we explore tradeoffs between power and performance. Visualization algorithms themselves merit special consideration, since they are more data-intensive in nature than traditional HPC programs like simulation codes. This data-intensive property enables different approaches for optimizing power usage. Our study focuses on the isosurfacing algorithm, and explores changes in power and performance as clock frequency changes, as power usage is highly dependent on clock frequency. We vary many of the factors seen in the HPC context-programming model (MPI vs. OpenMP), implementation (generalized vs. optimized), concurrency, architecture, and data set-and measure how these changes affect power-performance properties. The result is a study that informs the best approaches for optimizing energy usage for a representative visualization algorithm. © 2015 IEEE."
10,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Evaluating the efficacy of wavelet configurations on turbulent-flow data,"I/O is increasingly becoming a significant constraint for simulation codes and visualization tools on modern supercomputers. Data compression is an attractive workaround, and, in particular, wavelets provide a promising solution. However, wavelets can be applied in multiple configurations, and the variations in configuration impact accuracy, storage cost, and execution time. While the variation in these factors over wavelet configurations have been explored in image processing, they are not well understood for visualization and analysis of scientific data. To illuminate this issue, we evaluate multiple wavelet configurations on turbulent-flow data. Our approach is to repeat established analysis routines on uncompressed and lossy-compressed versions of a data set, and then quantitatively compare their outcomes. Our findings show that accuracy varies greatly based on wavelet configuration, while storage cost and execution time vary less. Overall, our study provides new insights for simulation analysts and visualization experts, who need to make tradeoffs between accuracy, storage cost, and execution time. © 2015 IEEE."
11,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Utilizing many-core accelerators for halo and center finding within a cosmology simulation,"Efficiently finding and computing statistics about halos (regions of high density) are essential analysis steps for N-body cosmology simulations. However, in state-of-the-art simulation codes, these analysis operators do not currently take advantage of the shared-memory data-parallelism available on multi-core and many-core architectures. The Hybrid / Hardware Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) is designed as an MPI+X code, but the analysis operators are parallelized only among MPI ranks, because of the difficulty in porting different X implementations (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA) across all architectures on which it is run. In this paper, we present portable data-parallel algorithms for several variations of halo finding and halo center finding algorithms. These are implemented with the PISTON component of the VTK-m framework, which uses Nvidia's Thrust library to construct data-parallel algorithms that allow a single implementation to be compiled to multiple backends to target a variety of multi-core and many-core architectures. Finally, we compare the performance of our halo and center finding algorithms against the original HACC implementations on the Moonlight, Stampede, and Titan supercomputers. The portability of Thrust allowed the same code to run efficiently on each of these architectures. On Titan, the performance improvements using our code have enabled halo analysis to be performed on a very large data set (81923 particles across 16,384 nodes of Titan) for which analysis using only the existing CPU algorithms was not feasible. © 2015 IEEE."
12,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Large interactive visualization of density functions on big data infrastructure,"Point set visualization is required in lots of visualization techniques. Scatter plots as well as geographic heat-maps are straightforward examples. Data analysts are now well trained to use such visualization techniques. The availability of larger and larger datasets raises the need to make these techniques scale as fast as the data grows. The Big Data Infrastructure offers the possibility to scale horizontally. Designing point set visualization methods that fit into that new paradigm is thus a crucial challenge. In this paper, we present a complete architecture which fully fits into the Big Data paradigm and so enables interactive visualization of heatmaps at ultra-scale. A new distributed algorithm for multi-scale aggregation of point set is given and an adaptive GPU based method for kernel density estimation is proposed. A complete prototype working with Hadoop, HBase, Spark and WebGL has been implemented. We give a benchmark of our solution on a dataset having more than 2 billion points. © 2015 IEEE."
13,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Bandlimited OLAP cubes for interactive big data visualization,"Visualizations backed by data cubes can scale to massive datasets while remaining interactive. However, the use of data cubes introduces artifacts, causing these visualizations to appear noisy at best and deceptive at worst. Moreover, data cubes highly constrain the space of possible visualizations. For example, a histogram backed by a data cube is constrained to have a bin width that is a multiple of the data cube bin size. Similarly, for dynamic queries backed by data cubes, query extents must be aligned with bin boundaries. We present bandlimited OLAP (online analytical processing) cubes (BLOCs), a technique that uses established tools from digital signal processing to generate interactive visualizations of very large datasets. Based on kernel density plots and Gaussian filtering, BLOCs suppress the artifacts that occur in data cubes and allow for a continuous range of zoom/pan positions and continuous dynamic queries. © 2015 IEEE."
14,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,A visualization pipeline for large-scale tractography data,"We present a novel methodology for clustering and visualizing large-scale tractography data sets. Tractography data sets contain hundreds of millions of line segments, making visualizing and understanding this data very difficult. Our method reduces and simplifies this data to create coherent groupings and visualizations. Our input is a collection of tracts, from which we derive metrics and perform clustering. Using the clustered data, we create a three-dimensional histogram that contains the counts of the number of tracts that intersect each bin. With these new data sets, we can perform standard visualization techniques. Our contribution is the visualization pipeline itself, as well as a study and evaluation schema. Our study utilizes our evaluation schema to identify the best and most influential clustering metrics, and an optimal number of clusters under varying user requirements. © 2015 IEEE."

16,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Fuzzy clustering of network traffic features for security,"The proliferation of computer networks and the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection using fuzzy clustering of TCP packet attributes. The method is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to evolutionary approaches. In addition, the method demonstrates improved robustness in comparison to other fuzzy clustering techniques. © 2015 IEEE."
17,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Skydive: An interactive data visualization engine,"Visualization provides a powerful means for data analysis. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at fast rates. This becomes increasingly difficult with the increasing size of real-world datasets. First, large databases make interactivity more difficult as a query across the entire data can be slow. Second, any attempt to show all items from a dataset will overload the visualization, resulting in clutter. © 2015 IEEE."
18,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,ViQAP: Visualizing quality aspects of public transportation between cities in a region,"In this work, we present our experience in extracting, handling, and visualizing the Public Transportation System (PTS) data of the Rheinland-Pfalz region in Germany. The work shows the methodology we followed to extract large data records for each city in the region as well as the resulting visualizing approach. The preliminary visualization interface, called ViQAP, provides visually different information (e.g., the number of commuters at a particular time, number of changes for a connection, an arrival timing comparison, etc.) between a selected city and all the other cities in the region, which helps the urban planners and region managers in better understanding the commuters' activities. © 2015 IEEE."
19,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Streaming ultra high resolution images to large tiled display at nearly interactive frame rate with vl3,"Visualization of large-scale simulations running on supercomputers requires ultra-high resolution images to capture important features in the data. In this work, we present a system for streaming ultra-high resolution images from a visualization cluster to a remote tiled display at nearly interactive frame rates. vl3, a modular framework for large scale data visualization and analysis, provides the backbone of our implementation. With this system we are able to stream over the network volume renderings of a 20483 voxel dataset at a resolution of 6144×3072 pixels with a frame rate of approximately 3.3 frames per second. © 2015 IEEE."
20,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Distributed aggregate computation between server and client for interactive visualization,"A visualization system is frequently challenged by large volume of datasets to be processed. The situation becomes more serious when visual feedback is required to be responsive. In this paper, an adaptive approach is proposed to efficiently distribute aggregate computation load between server and client for interactive visualization. This proposal combines available computing power on both server and client sides. Additionally, adaptively shifts part of the aggregate computation load to and fro for achieving interactive rate of large data visualization. An experimental prototype confirmed that that proposed method improves interactive rate of large data visualization. © 2015 IEEE."
21,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Advanced aggregate computation for large data visualization,"Large data visualization and analysis faces challenges related to performance, operability, degree of discrimination, etc. In this paper, an advanced aggregate computation is proposed to solve these issues from three aspects. By virtue of visualization-based data separation and aggregation, a large dataset is mapped to a visualization-based small dataset for efficient visualization while keeping operability of data. A minimum size of visual primitives for aggregated data is defined to ensure visibility of important but tiny information. And a D3-based rendering implementation improves the performance of consecutive visualizations. © 2015 IEEE."
22,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,CEDARS: Combined exploratory data analysis recommender system,"We present a framework for recommender systems (RS) to support exploratory data analysis (EDA) in analytical decision making. EDA helps the domain expert, often not a statistical expert, discover interesting relationships between variables and thus be motivated to explain the data. By capturing the behavior of expert analysts in EDA, RS could advise domain experts of standard analytical operations and suggest operations novel to the domain but consistent in analytical goals with requested operations. We enhance our framework with rules that encapsulate standard analytical practice and by incorporating user preferences. We present a scalable framework architecture, which we implemented in a prototype system, and discuss two use cases where the prototype was exercised, analyzing data from image analysis and analyzing eye tracking data. © 2015 IEEE."
23,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Large-scale co-visualization for LAMMPS using vl3,"In this poster we propose to interconnect LAMMPS and vl3, our parallel framework for large-scale visualization and analysis. The goal is co-visualization and exploration at interactive frame rates of large-scale atomistic simulations. We describe the architecture of the proposed system, as well as a preliminary implementation that runs on GPU-based visualization clusters. © 2015 IEEE."
24,International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP),2015,Tracking space-filling structures in turbulent flows,"We present a novel approach for tracking space-filling features, i.e. a set of features which covers the entire domain. In contrast to previous work, we determine the assignment between features from successive time steps by computing a globally optimal, maximum-weight, maximal matching on a weighted, bi-partite graph. We demonstrate the method's functionality by tracking dissipation elements (DEs), a space-filling structure definition from turbulent flow analysis. The abilitytotrack DEs over time enables researchers from fluid mechanics to extend their analysis beyond the assessment of static flow fields to time-dependent settings. © 2015 IEEE."
