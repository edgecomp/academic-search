0,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Integrating WebRTC and X3DOM: Bridging the gap between communications and graphics,"In recent years, with the emergence of HTML5, the Web has managed to evolve from an Internet application for information announcement and exchange to a toolkit provided for pervasive, ubiquitous and collaborative services. In this context, the Web can ultimately provide Real-Time Communication (RTC) services between browsers via the Internet. WebRTC is the standardized project that provides browsers and mobile applications with RTC capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs. This opens new horizons in web-based applications such as capabilities for online gaming, support for complicated 3D graphics in real-time, videoconferencing, exchanging of text messages, immersive technology, etc. In this paper, we introduce the integration of WebRTC capabilities within virtual 3D worlds and present several implementations that bridge WebRTC and X3DOM technologies. In the applications we have developed, virtual 3D collaborative environments are provided for the cooperation of web peers at real time, while they are able to manipulate a 3D scene without the use of plugins. In this context, an online educational game and an immersive conference tool supporting all types of real-time communication such as video chat, text messaging and the use of social media, both using WebRTC over X3DOM, are presented and thoroughly discussed. © 2015 ACM."
1,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Evaluating 3D thumbnails for virtual object galleries,"Virtual 3D object galleries on the Web nowadays often use realtime, interactive 3D graphics. However, this does usually still not hold for their preview images, sometimes referred to as thumbnails. We provide a technical analysis on the applicability of so-called 3D thumbnails within the context virtual 3D object galleries. Like a 2D thumbnail for an image, a 3D thumbnail acts as a compact preview for a real 3D model. In contrast to an image series, however, it enables a wider variety of interaction methods and rendering effects. By performing a case study, we show that such true 3D representations are, under certain circumstances, even able to outperform 2D image series in terms of bandwidth consumption. We thus present a complete pipeline for generating compact 3D thumbnails for given meshes in a fully automatic fashion. © 2015 ACM."
2,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,X3D Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) implementation and run-time discovery of new entities using X3DOM,"New capabilities in web browser JavaScript implementations including networking, improved graphics performance, and improved speed allow the implementation of Networked Virtual Environments (NVEs) inside the web browser. An NVE can be written in JavaScript, which enables deployment in the enterprise entirely from a web server without the use of browser plugins. We discuss one implementation of this idea using X3DOM, an opensource implementation of the X3D standard written in JavaScript. The Open-DIS library for the IEEE Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) network protocol is used to create a partial implementation of the X3D standard's DIS profile. Mechanisms for using the X3D DIS Profile DISEntityTypeMapping and DISEntityManager to enable run-time discovery and launching of new entities are discussed. Measurements of the capabilities and performance aspects of Websockets for network transport demonstrate excellent results."
3,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,"The X3D geospatial component: X3DOM implementation of GeoOrigin, GeoLocation, geoviewpoint, and GeoPositionInterpolator nodes","We present new implementations of important X3D nodes which enable a large class of geospatial applications in standard web browsers. We have chosen the freely available X3DOM code base as an implementation framework since it provides a very functional set of X3D nodes along with a broad selection of support functionality. In our implementations of the GeoOrigin, GeoLocation, GeoViewpoint and GeoPositionInterpolator nodes, we fully conform to the ISO specification and use well known example scenes as references for correctness. While GeoOrigin is deprecated in version 3.3 of the specification, we demonstrate that limited precision in the WebGL rendering pipeline still makes its use desirable at least until alternative solutions are formalized and coded. GeoLocation and GeoViewpoint nodes require specific alignments of coordinate systems which we document in detail. In addition, GeoViewpoint has the property to control navigation speed which conceptually conflicts with user speed control. We resolve this conflict by using relative speed and also make this control optional. Somewhat terse language in the GeoPositionInterpolator specification required clarification of its existing usage and inspired an option for coordinate interpolation along great circles which is often the expected interpolation path in global scenes. Finally, all functionality was integrated into current, stable releases of the X3DOM distribution available from www.x3dom.org. © 2015 ACM."
4,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,"WebVis/instant3DHub - Visual Computing as a Service infrastructure to deliver adaptive, secure and scalable user centric data visualisation","This paper presents the webVis/instant3DHub platform, which combines a novel Web-Components based framework and a Visual Computing as a Service infrastructure to deliver an interactive 3D data visualisation solution. The system focuses on minimising resource consumption, while maximising the end-user experience. It utilises an adaptive and automated combination of client, server and hybrid visualisation techniques, while orchestrating transmission, caching and rendering services to deliver structural and semantically complex data sets on any device class and network architecture. The API and Web Component framework allow the application developer to compose and manipulate complex data setups with a simple set of commands inside the browser, without requiring knowledge about the underlying service infrastructure, interfaces and the fully automated processes. This results in a new class of interactive applications, built around a canvas for real-time visualisation of massive data sets. © 2015 ACM."
5,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,X3D sensor-based thermal maps for residential and commercial buildings,"There are many building energy simulation systems on the market today; however, most of them rely on theoretical thermal models to make decisions on the building structural design and modifications. Sustainable methods of construction have made tremendous progress in the recent decades. The example of the German Energy-Plus-House technology uses a combination of (almost) zero-carbon passive heating technologies. A webenabled X3D simulation system coupled with a cost-effective set of temperature/humidity sensors can provide valuable insights into building design, materials and construction that can lead to significant energy savings, an improved thermal comfort for residents and improved efficiency. We propose a cost effective hardware-software prototype system that can provide real data driven 3D thermal maps for residential buildings. The system can easily scale to provide 3D thermal maps for large commercial buildings. © 2015 ACM."

7,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Volumetric texture data compression scheme for transmission,"We present a texture data compression technique for transmission of volumetric weather radar data. High resolution volume rendering of such time varying volumetric data sets requires large size and number of texture files. In case of WebGL based volume rendering on web browsers, performance problems occur due to the latencies associated with loading of 3D assets, especially transmission of huge texture files. Existing compression technique can help to solve this problem. The most relevant work is S3TC texture compression. As an advanced compression scheme, we combine the S3TC compression method with efficient encoding of volume data in the RGBA channels of an image followed by DEFLATE compression to further reduce the file size. We show how this optimized scheme with X3D/X3DOM extensions fits into our weather data visualization application requirements and provide experimental results. © 2015 ACM."

9,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Webized 3D experience by HTML5 annotation in 3D Web,"With the development of 3D Web technologies, 3D objects are now handled as embedded objects without plug-ins on web pages. Although declarative 3D objects are physically integrated into web pages, 3D objects and HTML elements are still separated from the perspective of the 3D layout context, and an annotation method is lacking. Thus it is scarcely possible to add meaningful annotations related to target 3D objects using existing web resources. In addition, people often lose the relationship between the target and related annotation objects in a 3D context due to the separation of the content layouts in different 3D contexts. In this paper, we propose a webizing method for annotating user experiences with 3D objects in a 3D Web environment. The relationship between the 3D target object and the annotation object is declared by means of web annotations and these related objects are rendered with a common 3D layout context and a camera perspective. We present typical cases of 3D scenes with web annotations on the 3D Web using a prototype implementation system to verify the usefulness of our approach. © 2015 ACM."
10,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Urban data visualisation in a web browser,"CityGML is a recent standard developed to describe, store and exchange virtual city models. Numerous software programmes have been proposed to construct, edit, modify and visualize city models, but visualisation in a web browser is still challenging. In this paper we propose a framework based on standards for visualising a large amount of 3D city data. CityGML files are processed automatically to provide a city model composed of geometries, textures and semantics. Exchanges follow the pending Open Geospatial standard named 3D portrayal. In this paper, we also demonstrate that a solution where semantics and geometries are exchanged together is possible. An effort has been made to show that an approach based on progressive textures may also be possible. © 2015 ACM."
11,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Applicability of watermarking for intellectual property rights protection in a 3D printing scenario,"The potential of 3D printing to revolutionize manufacturing is becoming today a reality. Also referred to a class of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, 3D printing enables mass customization and manufacturing of device components, parts of houses, human organs and even food. It reduces production costs, manufacturing time, and necessary storage space. Due to this success, the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) for 3D printed models raises increased concerns. Among technologies enabling copyright protection, traitor tracing and authentication, 3D watermarking has received a lot of interest from the research community in the context of 3D digital models. In this paper we give an overview of the state of the art of 3D digital watermarking and we assess how it could be extended for ensuring the IPR protection of printed 3D models. By considering 3D printing and scanning as an attack, we evaluate the potential of state-of-the-art watermarking techniques to provide both robust protection and also high fidelity as the introduced shape perturbations should not impair the mechanical properties or functionalities of the printed 3D model. © 2015 ACM."
12,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Web-based data visualization of an MMO virtual regatta using a virtual globe,"In this paper we present the methods and techniques used to visualize the trajectory of the participants of a massive virtual regatta using a virtual globe in the web browser. The emergence of new web technologies, such as HTML5 and WebGL, have opened new avenues for visualizing and sharing 3D data. However, web-based visualization of big data is still challenging, as the power of the web browser for 3D visualization has still not reached the level of desktop applications. In this work, we use WebGL to visualize the path of the 17000 virtual boats that participated in the MMO game of the Barcelona World Race 2015, and present optimization strategies for the rendering of this Big Data (which is otherwise impossible to render in a web context on standard consumer hardware). We also combine this optimization with a render-to-texture approach to visualize the density of the boat routes, rendering and visualizing the data progressively, and using web workers for processing and managing the data. © 2015 ACM."

15,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Remote visualization of dynamic molecular data using WebGL,"Visualization of dynamic data from molecular dynamics simulations is crucial for understanding the functioning of molecules. Many existing visualization tools have mainly focused on supporting a single user working on a desktop computer. Technical advancements in browser features increase the potential for the development of web-based collaborative visualization tools. Although web-based molecular viewers already exist, their support for dynamic molecular data at interactive rates is lacking. To address this gap, we present an efficient web application for visualization of dynamic molecular data using WebGL that exploits HTML5 technologies like WebSockets and Web Workers. We demonstrate the feasibility to visualize large dynamic molecular data in the browser at interactive frame rates. Moreover, the application can be employed for remote simulation monitoring on mobile devices. Our approach allows scientists at arbitrary locations to concurrently visually analyze the same data. The interactive parametrization of the visualization can be shared among multiple clients, providing the basis for collaborative research. © 2015 ACM."
16,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Semantic query-based generation of customized 3D scenes,"The paper presents a method of building generalized content representations - 3D meta-scenes, and on-demand generation of customized final 3D scenes with the use of semantic queries. The presented method enables generation of 3D scenes by the use of selection, projection, composition and extension operations, performed in the semantic domain, providing a powerful mechanism for content customization. The use of semantics simplifies customization of 3D scenes, which usually consist of complex components with complex dependencies between them. The resulting scenes can be presented using existing 3D web browsers. © 2015 ACM."
17,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Procedural generation and interactive web visualization of natural environments,"Interactive 3D visualization of natural environments can help ecologists, policy makers and the broad public in general to better understand, promote and protect both existing and developing environments. The creation and exploration of virtual worlds can be very helpful for this purpose. However, current techniques are neither able to generate sound natural environments from ecological data nor do they provide web-based visualizations at interactive rates of such detailed ecological systems. In this paper, we approach the challenge of developing and interactively visualizing in real time ecologically accurate and visually convincing models of complex natural environments over the web. For this, we propose a framework that (i) is able to combine landscape maps and ecological statistical data, translating them to an ecologically sound plant distribution, and (ii) creates a detailed 3D representation of the natural environment and provides for its fully interactive visualization in real-time over the web. The main contribution of our research consists of the real-time web-based visualization of complete and visually convincing natural environments with their high density and variability of individual organisms. The vegetation model combines and improves techniques from procedural ecosystem generation and neutral landscape modeling. It is able to generate diverse ecological sound plant distribution directly from landscape maps with statistics about coverage and patchiness of plant species. The visualization model uses several existing level-of-detail and illumination techniques to achieve interactive frame rates and improve realism. From the validation of the results with ecology experts we conclude that our framework provides very convincing interactive visualizations of large virtual natural environments. © 2015 ACM."
18,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,WebGL virtual globe for efficient forest production planning in mountainous area,"This paper illustrates a 3D web-based visual simulation system that supports spatial-information based realistic modelling and real-time rendering of forest scenes. 3D visualization of forest landscapes will be used to understand stand ecological succession, landscape transformation helping regional planning and improving decision-making processes and forest management through what-if analysis tools. The goal of the presented project is to deploy a web system able to easily provide access to forestry information, typically managed in GIS or dedicated system, ensuring the fruition of this information to non-geospatial experts like forest owners and field operators.Technologies such as HTML5, WebGL, CSS 3D and Canvas element have been chosen as the most suitable for the interactive visualization of the forest model placed in the context of a virtual globe representation of the Earth using a highly customized version of the CesiumJS virtual globe, called GeoBrowser3D. Powered by WebGL and state of the art software technologies it offers a three-dimensional Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant solution, integrated with computational and visual techniques for decision making environments. This solution allows large scale GIS data visualization such as maps and forest models, as well as high detail small scale information such as point clouds or stems structures that are automatically generated according to inventory database and predesigned template models. Additionally, forest activity planners can have access to larger scale datasets like roads and cadastral maps as well as single timber information. The system has been tested and evaluated in applications of walkthrough simulation and forest visualization. The test site is situated in Northern Italy, close to Sover in the Trentino region. © 2015 ACM."
19,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,3D.graz.at: Efficient online city model,"online to organize the model into projects and publish with CityEngineViewer© to present the city model online with extendable functions, all for free! One practical way from 3d model building to online presentation is shown. The highlight of the procedure may be summarized into following: • Using photogrammetric measurements and other vector and raster data to generate 3d city model automatically; • Combination of different layers for more information presentation and more functions; • Extensible layer structure; • 3D city model without plugin for most browsers; • Efficient work procedure for practical application."

It uses X3D as a scene graph, and also as it's main 3D and 2D interchange format. In this poster we would like to highlight some engine architectural advantages. © 2015 ACM."
21,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,A 3D collaborative editor using WebGL and WebRTC,"In 3D collaborative environments, users needs interactivity and real-time updates. With web-based applications, such requirement implies that conventional client-server-alone-is no longer enough. To overcome this unmet need, we propose a hybrid client server peer-to-peer (P2P) communication model based on pluginless web standards enabling users to design collaboratively 3D scenes. The client part includes a WebGL editor to visualize and edit 3D scenes while the server side provides data and ensure persistence. Using the WebRTC protocol, a P2P mesh is generated to transmit directly the updates through a scenes working group. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated with a web-based prototype submitted to a qualitative evaluation highlighting the usage of WebRTC for direct 3D data transmission with low latency and high throughput, and WebGL for 3D rendering. © 2015 ACM."
22,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Crowd simulation rendering for web,"Simulation and rendering of large crowds are very demanding tasks on computational resources and until recently were inconceivable to be performed by a web browser. However, with the increasing capacity of GPUs and the maturation of web front-end development, could a web-based simulation of massive crowds be achieved in real-time in today's web-browsers? In this work we present the implementation of a minimal visualization tool for crowd simulation results, with the ability of rendering thousands of animated agents in real-time using WebGL. We also briefly present some current challenges of accomplishing crowd simulations in a web environment. © 2015 ACM."

It is recognized however [Smith and Blagoderov 2012] that such physical collections are often heavily underutilized as a result of the practical issues of accessibility. The digitization of these collections is a step towards removing these access issues, but other hurdles must be addressed before we truly unlock the potential of this knowledge. © 2015 ACM."
25,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,A proposed model for cross-platform web 3D applications on Smart TV systems,"Smart TV systems are becoming increasingly popular. New and more powerful models are being released, while more units are being sold every year, gaining an ever-expanding user base. One of the standard features of these devices is the Internet connectivity and the ability to browse the worldwide web. In this study we explore the possibilities of viewing 3D web content on Smart TV systems. A system architecture is proposed for maximum compatibility of web applications that utilize 3D features. Initial results, show that real-time Web 3D is now possible on Smart TVs, although in an experimental stage, but the proposed model can solve compatibility problems, even on older devices, by using a fallback strategy for unsupported features, enabling the development of cross-platform 3D applications. © 2015 ACM."

28,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Fusality: An open framework for cross-platform Mirror World installations,"As computing and displays become more pervasive and wireless networks are increasing the connections between people and things, humans inhabit both digital and physical realities. In this paper we describe our prototype Mirror Worlds framework, which is designed to fuse these realities: Fusality. Our goal for Fusality is to support innovative research and exhibitions in presence and collaboration, sensors and smart buildings and mixed reality in applications from engineering to art. By fusing live sensor data from the building and its occupants with online 3D environments and participants, we demonstrate a firstprinciples approach to online multi-entity messaging communication. This demonstration shows how the variety of Mirror Worlds clients can be supported through the open Web architecture. These technologies enable new possibilities for collaboration as well as directions for interoperability. Finally, we layout out our research agenda for the framework and discuss its transformative applications. © 2015 ACM."
29,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Indoor3D: A WebGL based open source framework for 3D indoor maps visualization,"In this paper, we present Indoor3D, an open source framework for 3D indoor maps visualization. It takes advantage of the WebGL technique of modern browsers, so it can work on any platform which supports the WebGL feature, including desktop computers and mobile devices. An extensible data structure is designed to describe the indoor scene. The proper default view is generated automatically according to the principal direction. A priority based algorithm is employed to control the visibility of the texts and icons. This library is well designed and easy to use. Developers can create an indoor map and customize its behaviour with only a few codes. Designers also benefit from this framework since they can change its visual style by providing a new theme. We believe our Indoor3D will be useful in many cases, such as airports, subway stations and shopping malls. © 2015 ACM."
30,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,A case study on 3D geospatial applications in the Web using state-of-the-art WebGL frameworks,"We evaluate three Open-Source WebGL frameworks (X3DOM, three.js and Cesium) and investigate their use for geospatial applications in the Web. Over the course of one year we carried out five case studies and developed different software prototypes using these frameworks. We focus on geospatial applications since they require unique features that bring the evaluated WebGL frameworks to their limits. Geospatial data is typically heterogeneous and very large. Geospatial applications require special data management and interaction techniques. We describe the criteria that we defined to test the WebGL solutions and present our experience from working with them. We give a qualitative comparison and finish the paper with conclusions and an outlook on future research perspectives. © 2015 ACM."
31,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Fast decompression for web-based view-dependent 3D rendering,"Efficient transmission of 3D data to Web clients and mobile applications remains a challenge due to limited bandwidth. Most of the research focus in the context of mesh compression has been on improving compression ratio. However, in this context the use of Javascript on the Web and low power CPUS in mobile applications led to critical computational costs. Progressive decoding improves the user experience by providing a simplified version of the model that refines with time, and it's able to mask latency. Current approaches do so at very poor compression rates or at additional computational cost. The need for better performing algorithms is especially evident with this class of methods where Limper [Limper et al. 2013b] demonstrated how decoding time becomes a limiting factor even at moderately low bandwidths. In this paper we present a novel multi-resolution WebGL based rendering algorithm which combines progressive loading, view-dependent resolution and mesh compression, providing high frame rates and a decoding speed of million of triangles per second in Javascript. This method is parallelizable, robust to non-manifold meshes, and scalable to very large models. © 2015 ACM."
32,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,A CSS integration model for declarative 3D,"Declarative 3D (Dec3D) implementations, most notably XML3D and X3DOM, have enabled a seamless integration of 3D and 2D content on the same web page. Yet one of the major web technologies, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), has not been integrated. The usage of CSS for 3D content has always been envisaged but never fully approached, because only polyfills for declarative 3D implementations exist and only recent developments have made custom CSS properties available. In this paper we will present a deep integration and adaption of CSS for Dec3D content and, hence, provide the final component necessary to fully integrate 3D content into the web technology stack. Our integration model allows for appearance definitions, such as visibility and materials, at a novel level of expressiveness. CSS-Selectors, inheritance, as well as media types provide unique means to change a scene's final appearance in a flexible and powerful way. Using CSS, it is possible to define the appearance of a 3D object dependent on the DOM hierarchy position or the screen resolution and orientation without a single line of JavaScript. The integration of CSS further enables the use of browser debugging facilities that have not been usable before. Because the requirements of 3D content are different compared to those of 2D content, we will point out existing limitations and necessary future additions to improve the interoperability of CSS with 3D content. © 2015 ACM."
33,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Dynamic 3D visualizations of complex function surfaces using X3DOM and WebGL,"In 1997 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) embarked on a huge project to replace one of the most cited resources for mathematical, physical and engineering scientists, the Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables [Abramowitz and Stegun 1964], originally released by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in 1964. The 1997 project, designed to update and modernize the handbook, culminated in May 2010 with the launch of a freely available website, the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions [DLMF] (http://dlmf.nist.gov/), and its print companion, the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions [Olver et al. 2010]. While the presence of graphics was sparse in the original handbook, the new resource contains more than 600 illustrations of high level mathematical functions, including close to 200 interactive 3D visualizations on the website. We provide the motivation for the visualization work through the context of the project and discuss our current implementation using X3DOM and WebGL."
34,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Textured splat-based point clouds for rendering in handheld devices,"We propose a novel technique for modeling and rendering a 3D point cloud obtained from a set of photographs of a real 3D scene as a set of textured elliptical splats. We first obtain the base splat model by calculating, for each point of the cloud, an ellipse approximating locally the underlying surface. We then refine the base model by removing redundant splats to minimize overlaps, and merging splats covering flat regions of the point cloud into larger ellipses. We later apply a multi-texturing process to generate a single texture atlas from the set of photographs, by blending information from multiple cameras for every splat. Finally, we render this multitextured, splat-based 3D model with an efficient implementation of OpenGL ES 2.0 vertex and fragment shaders which guarantees its fluid display on handheld devices. © 2015 ACM."
35,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,SPLASH: A hybrid 3D modeling/rendering approach mixing SPLAts and meSHes,"We propose a hybrid 3D modeling and rendering approach called SPLASH to combine the modeling flexibility and robustness of SPLAts together with the rendering simplicity and maturity of meSHes. Together with this novel SPLASH concept, we also propose a system turning a 3D point cloud, obtained for example through an SfM (Structure from Motion) approach, into a multitextured hybrid 3D model whose shape is described by a triangle mesh plus a collection of elliptical splats. © 2015 ACM."
36,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,3drepo.io: Building the next generation web3D repository with AngularJS and X3DOM,"This paper presents a novel open source web-based 3D version control system positioned directly within the context of the recent strategic plan for digitising the construction sector in the United Kingdom. The aim is to achieve reduction of cost and carbon emissions in the built environment by up to 20% simply by properly managing digital information and 3D models. Even though previous works in the field concentrated mainly on defining novel WebGL frameworks and later on the efficiency of 3D data delivery over the Internet, there is still the emerging need for a practical solution that would provide ubiquitous access to 3D assets, whether it is for large international enterprises or individual members of the general public. We have, therefore, developed a novel platform leveraging the latest open web-based technologies such as AngularJS and X3DOM in order to define an industrial-strength collaborative cloud hosting service 3drepo.io. Firstly, we introduce the work and outline the high-level system architecture as well as improvements in relation to previous work. Next, we describe database and frontend considerations with emphasis on scalability and enhanced security. Finally, we present several performance measurement experiments and a selection of real-life industrial use cases. We conclude that jQuery provides performance benefits over AngularJS when manipulating large scene graphs in web browsers. © 2015 ACM."

39,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Model-based design of multimodal interaction for augmented reality web applications,"Despite the increasing use of Augmented Reality (AR) in many different application areas, implementation support is limited and still driven by development at source-code level. Although efforts have been made to overcome these limitations, there is a clear gap between authoring environments and source code level framework approaches for creating AR interfaces for the web with multimodal control. Model-based design for interaction can offer support to fill this gap between authoring environments and frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, a declarative and model-driven design (MDD) has not yet been applied to model AR interfaces for a wide spectrum of modes. Thus, this paper presents an extension of the model-driven design to cope with interactors, whose novelty lies on the introduction of a modeling approach targeted at AR developers and designers in their task to design new forms of interactions that can be later used in authoring environments. To validate our approach, we demonstrate how a reality spanning Drag-and-Drop interaction can be modeled for an online furniture shop. And we implemented a gesture based control to show how new control modes can be added to an existing MDD-based design to extend the interaction capabilities. © 2015 ACM."
40,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Dynamic adaptive mesh streaming for real-time 3D teleimmersion,"Recent advances in full body 3D reconstruction methods have lead to the realisation of high quality, real-time, photo realistic capture of users in a range of tele-immersion (TI) contexts including gaming and mixed reality environments. The full body reconstruction (FBR) process is computationally expensive requiring comparatively high CPU, GPU and network resources in order to maintain a shared, virtual reality in which high quality 3D reproductions of users can be rendered in real-time. A significant optimisation of the delivery of FBR content has been achieved through the realtime compression and de-compression of 3D geometry and textures. Here we present a new, adaptive compression methodology that allows a TI system called 3D-LIVE to modify the quality and speed of a FBR TI pipeline based on the data carrying capability of the network. Our rule-based adaptation strategy uses network performance sampling processes and a configurable rule engine to dynamically alter the compression of FBR reconstruction on-the-fly. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach with an experimental evaluation of system and conclude with a discussion of future directions for adaptive FBR compression. © 2015 ACM."

42,International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing,2015,Online interactive 4D character animation,"This paper presents a framework for creating realistic virtual characters that can be delivered via the Internet and interactively controlled in a WebGL enabled web-browser. Four-dimensional performance capture is used to capture realistic human motion and appearance. The captured data is processed into efficient and compact representations for geometry and texture. Motions are analysed against a high-level, user-defined motion graph and suitable inter- and intra-motion transitions are identified. This processed data is stored on a webserver and downloaded by a client application when required. A Javascript-based character animation engine is used to manage the state of the character which responds to user input and sends required frames to a WebGL-based renderer for display. Through the efficient geometry, texture and motion graph representations, a game character capable of performing a range of motions can be represented in 40-50 MB of data. This highlights the potential use of four-dimensional performance capture for creating web-based content. Datasets are made available for further research and an online demo is provided 1. © 2015 ACM."
