0,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,A pausible bisynchronous FIFO for GALS systems,"Many of the challenges of modern SoC design can be mitigated or eliminated with globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) design techniques. Partitioning a design into many synchronous islands introduces myriad asynchronous boundary crossings which typically incur high latency. We have designed a pausible bisynchronous FIFO that achieves low interface latency with a pausible clocking scheme. While traditional synchronizers have a non-zero probability of metastability and error, pausible clocking enables error-free operation by permitting infrequent slowdowns in the clock rate. Unlike prior pausible synchronizers, our circuit employs standard two-ported synchronous FIFOs, common circuit elements that integrate well with standard toolflows. The pausible bisynchronous FIFO achieves an average latency of 1.34 cycles across an asynchronous interface while using less energy and area than traditional synchronizers. © 2015 IEEE."
1,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,How to synchronize a pausible clock to a reference,"Pausible clocking is an efficient means for metastability free communication in heterochronous GALS systems. State-of-the-art implementations are based on ring oscillators, which suffer from bad frequency stability and accuracy. Building a stable pausible clock by simply switching a crystal based clock source, on the other hand, has been shown to incur metastability issues, thus rendering pausible clocking no better than a conventional synchronizer approach. In this paper we propose a solution that provides the stability and accuracy of a crystal based clock while still being free from metastable upsets. It is based on a ring oscillator that can be paused and resumed just like in the traditional approach, but is synchronized with a crystal clock during its stable phases of operation. We will present an appropriate circuit implementation and carefully analyze its operation. We will give evidence that the circuit switches on and off as fast as the traditional one, and that the clock output does not suffer from metastable voltage or spurious pulses at any time. © 2015 IEEE."
2,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,"A low-latency, energy-efficient L1 cache based on a self-timed pipeline","The design of a low latency, energy-efficient selftimed L1 cache is presented. The pipeline integrates Octasic's token-based architecture and a two-phase handshake protocol derived from Click elements. Only standard flip-flops are used as state-holding elements for the pipeline control and datapath. Simulations and post-layout static timing analysis were based on a commercial 28nm bulk process. Power analysis indicates a 20% improvement in energy efficiency when compared to the previous synchronous cache for the same throughput and area. © 2015 IEEE."
3,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Synchronizers and data flip-flops are different,"Careful synchronizer design is imperative as System-on-Chip (SoC) products become prevalent in safetycritical applications. Previously, use of a flip-flop optimized for data applications was adequate for most synchronizer uses when laid out as a two-stage design. Increased demands for both reliability and low-power have exposed this two-stage solution to misuse. The recognition that a synchronizer should be optimized differently from a data flip-flop opens the design space to new approaches. Some examples are presented and two aides to the process are introduced. © 2015 European Union."
4,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Blade - A timing violation resilient asynchronous template,"Resilient designs offer the promise to remove increasingly large margins due to process, voltage, and temperature variations and take advantage of average-case data. However, proposed synchronous resilient schemes have either suffered from metastability or require modifying the architecture to add replay based logic that recovers from timing errors, which leads to high timing error penalties and poses a design challenge in modern processors. This paper presents an asynchronous bundled-data resilient template called Blade that is robust to metastability issues, requires no replay-based logic, and has low timing error penalties. The template is supported by an automated design flow that synthesizes synchronous RTL designs to gate-level asynchronous Blade designs. The benefits of this flow are illustrated on Plasma, a 3-stage OpenCore MIPS CPU. Our results demonstrate that a nominal area overhead of the asynchronous template of less than 10% leads to a 19% performance boost over the synchronous design due to average-case data and a 30-40% improvement when synchronous PVT margins are considered. © 2015 IEEE."
5,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Design and verification of speed-independent multiphase buck controller,"Power regulators and converters impose high requirements on the latency and resilience of their control circuitry. In this paper we design a speed-independent multiphase buck controller based on a novel lazy token ring architecture, that allows overlapping the charging cycles of multiple phases as well as simultaneous activation of all phases to handle the sudden power demand. The advantages over traditional synchronous designs include reliable handling of asynchronous inputs from sensors, low-latency reaction to the changes in power demand (undervoltage, over-current, zero-crossing and high-load conditions), and more balanced utilisation of charging phases. The essential correctness properties of the developed controller have been formally verified, and the whole buck has been validated in the industrial settings using exhaustive simulation. © 2015 IEEE."
6,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,"DD1: A QDI, radiation-hard-by-design, near-threshold 18uW/MIPS microcontroller in 40nm bulk CMOS","This paper describes DD1, an asynchronous radiation-hard 8-bit AVR® microcontroller (MCU) implemented in TSMC 40LP, a low-power bulk 40nm CMOS process. Designed for extreme reliability, DD1 uses quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI) asynchronous logic and contains full-custom radiation hard memories and logic cells. The chip was found fully functional on first silicon over a range of operating voltages from near-threshold (500mV) to above the nominal V DD (1.1V). It qualifies as both ultra-low power (<100μW/MHz) and radiationhard by design. At 550mV the MCU operates at 1MIPS with a power consumption of 18μW/MIPS. At 1.1V it runs at 20MIPS consuming 75μW/MIPS (1.5mW total). After extensive testing, it was found to be total-dose and latch-up immune and has an upset immunity of 2E-6 SEE/device-day (CREME96 geosynchronous near-earth orbit). © 2015 IEEE."
7,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Timing driven placement for quasi delay-insensitive circuits,"Asynchronous circuits offer promise in handling current and future technology scaling challenges. Unfortunately, their impact has been limited by the lack of design automation. We present A-NTUPLACE, a timing-driven placer uniquely suited to handling quasi delay-insensitive circuits. Our tool uses a generalization of repetitive event rule systems to identify critical signal transitions. The cell placement engine, based on a leading academic placer, NTUPlace3, incorporates net weights to minimize critical wirelengths as well as a novel balancing scheme to ensure isochronic fork constraints are met. We show that our placer is effective at both prioritizing selected nets and balancing forks, demonstrating improvements in 3 of our 4 benchmarks. © 2015 IEEE."
8,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Gate sizing and Vth assignment for asynchronous circuits using Lagrangian relaxation,"Gate sizing and threshold voltage selection is an important step in the VLSI physical design process to help reduce power consumption and improve circuit performance. Recent asynchronous design flows try to directly leverage synchronous EDA tools to select gates, which have a lot of limitations due to the intrinsic difference between asynchronous and synchronous circuits. This paper presents a new simultaneous gate sizing and Vth assignment approach for asynchronous designs. We formulate the asynchronous gate version selection problem considering both leakage power consumption and cycle time. Then, the optimization is performed based on a Lagrangian relaxation framework. A fast and effective slew updating strategy is also proposed to address the timing-loops of asynchronous circuits during static timing analysis. Our approach is evaluated using a set of asynchronous designs based on the pre-charged half buffer (PCHB) template and compared with the Proteus asynchronous design flow which is leveraging synchronous EDA tools. The experiments show our approach can achieve much better quality results in terms of both leakage power and cycle time compared with the other approach. © 2015 IEEE."
9,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Performance optimization and analysis of blade designs under delay variability,"As manufacturing processes continue to shrink and supply voltages drop, timing margins due to increased process, temperature, and voltage variability become a significant portion of the clock period. An asynchronous bundled data resilient template called Blade has recently been proposed to curb these margins and thereby outperform synchronous alternatives. This paper proposes a model to analyze the performance of Blade designs and an approach to optimize it. We validate the model against gate-level simulations of a resilient 3-stage MIPS CPU implemented with Blade and use it to compare the optimal performance of Blade designs with synchronous alternatives. The results show that Blade offers up to 44% higher performance than traditional designs and 23% higher performance than Bubble Razor, the synchronous resiliency strategy with the highest reported performance. © 2015 IEEE."
10,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Analyzing isochronic forks with potential causality,"Asynchrony and concurrency are fundamental notions in the fields of asynchronous circuits as well as distributed systems. This paper treats asynchronous circuits as a special class of distributed systems. We adapt the distributed systems notion of potential causality to asynchronous circuits, and use it to provide a formal proof of the precise nature of the isochronic fork timing assumption in quasi delay-insensitive (QDI) circuits. Our proofs provide a transparent analysis that provides better intuition regarding the operation of QDI circuits. We build on our theory to rigorously establish several ""folk theorems"" about identifying isochronic forks in QDI circuits. © 2015 IEEE."
11,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Naturalized communication and testing,"We ""naturalize"" the handshake communication links of a self-timed system by assigning the capabilities of filling and draining a link and of storing its full or empty status to the link itself. This contrasts with assigning these capabilities to the joints, the modules connected by the links, as was previously done. Under naturalized communication, the differences between Micropipeline, GasP, Mousetrap, and Click circuits are seen only in the links - the joints become identical; past, present, and future link and joint designs become interchangeable. We also ""naturalize"" the actions of a self-timed system, giving actions status equal to states - for the purpose of silicon test and debug. We partner traditional scan test techniques dedicated to STATE with new test capabilities dedicated to ACTION. To each and every joint, we add a novel proper-start-stop circuit, called MrGO, that permits or forbids the action of that joint. MrGO, pronounced ""Mister GO,"" makes it possible to (1) exit an initial state cleanly to start circuit operation in a delay-insensitive manner, (2) stop a running circuit in a clean and delay-insensitive manner, (3) single-or multi-step circuit operations for test and debug, and (4) test sub-systems at speed. © 2015 IEEE."
12,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,AES hardware-software co-design in WSN,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) present a challenging design space for encryption algorithms. We evaluate hardware, software, and hybrid implementations, including one of our own design, of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption engines in the context of WSN microcontrollers. We examine the tradeoffs between energy, throughput, memory footprint, and sensor network node lifetime. Our measured results and models show that our fully Quasi Delay-Insensitive, asynchronous AES design, combined with a low-power microcontroller, offers a 60x increase in throughput at 90x less energy per bit over the commercially available TI MSP430 AES WSN hardware. Our hardware AES offers a 30 x throughput improvement over its software counterpart, albeit with reduced lifetime. By incorporating power gating and providing dedicated memory resources to the AES engine, hybrid implementations can provide a 6x better throughput and increase the lifetime by 10 % over software. © 2015 IEEE."
13,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Low power monolithic 3D IC design of asynchronous AES core,"In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a monolithic 3D implementation of an asynchronous AES encryption core can achieve up to 50.3% footprint reduction, 25.7% improvement in power, 34.3% shorter wirelength and 6.06% reduced cell area compared to its 2D counterpart, at identical (ISO) performance. We also demonstrate that combining asynchronous circuits with 3D integration can yield a peak power reduction of 63.9% compared to the equivalent synchronous realisation. We also verified that the asynchronous implementation of the encryption core is more tolerant to monolithic 3D tier-tier variation compared to its synchronous counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the mutual benefits of asynchronous and monolithic 3D IC integration. © 2015 IEEE."
14,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Deadlock recovery in asynchronous networks on chip in the presence of transient faults,"Asynchronous Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have been proposed as a promising infrastructure to provide scalable and efficient on-chip communication for many-core systems. Using the Quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI) implementation, asynchronous NoCs could achieve timing-robustness. However, the advancing semiconductor technology leads to shrinking transistor dimensions and increasing chip density, accelerating the occurrence of faults, especially transient faults. Transient faults emerging on QDI circuits could cause not only data errors (symbol corruption and insertion), but also deadlock. When the deadlock happens on asynchronous NoCs, it can spread over the whole network and paralyse its function. This deadlock has not been fully studied while most traditional fault-tolerant techniques cannot deal with it. Using a new model built for QDI pipelines, the formation and behaviour of the deadlock caused by transient faults are systematically studied. Using the summarized deadlock patterns, the fault position can be precisely located and the fault type can be diagnosed. A fine-grained recovery mechanism is proposed to recover the network from different deadlocks. As a design case, an asynchronous NoC is designed which can recover from the deadlock caused by both transient and permanent faults on links. Detailed experimental results are given. © 2015 IEEE."
15,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Increasing impartiality and robustness in high-performance N-way asynchronous arbiters,"Arbiters are the most critical element to manage a shared resource. Many arbiters in the literature are asynchronous, in order to improve concurrency and make the performance independent from the working frequency of the requesting clients. However, in asynchronous designs, architectural imbalances or variability can affect impartiality, such as latency equalization and arbitration fairness. Such a problem has largely not been taken into account in previous designs and experimental results. This work aims to perform an accurate rebalancing for N-way arbiters, using a new architecture, based on a tree structure. The proposed architecture drastically mitigates various forms of impartiality, as well as enhances overall robustness. The design is also scalable and highly performance-oriented. A detailed comparison of several post-layout N-way arbiter models is included. Results show significant benefits over most critical design costs. © 2015 IEEE."
16,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Opportunistic merge element,"The paper introduces a new reusable asynchronous component, called Opportunistic Merge element, that merges two or more request-acknowledgement channels into one and is allowed to opportunistically bundle requests from different input channels if they arrive sufficiently close to each other. We present a speed-independent implementation of this component and verify some of its correctness properties. An important characteristic of the presented implementation is that the arbitration is removed from the critical path, thereby providing a fast response to the incoming requests. © 2015 IEEE."
17,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Design and analysis of testable mutual exclusion elements,"Mutual exclusion elements (MUTEXes) are fundamental components of asynchronous arbiters and are particularly critical to ensure metastable signals are properly filtered before reaching the arbiter outputs. However, despite their importance, the testability of these circuits is typically limited to functional testing. This paper discusses why this is not sufficient and addresses testability issues in both full-custom and standardcell implementations. In particular, it proposes two new testable implementations that not only ensure improved coverage for single stuck-at faults but also enable testing the filtering of metastable signals. Additionally, this article quantifies the cost of the testable designs by comparing them to similar traditional designs in terms of area, power and metastability resolution time. Results show the proposed optimizations do increase area and power but have small impact on performance. © 2015 IEEE."
18,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Asynchronous charge sharing power consistent montgomery multiplier,"A significant number of cryptographic architectures rely on the efficient and resilient implementation of the Montgomery modular multiplier. One of the most used attacks on cryptographic implementations is based on Differential Power Analysis (DPA) or one of its variants. In this paper, a specially adjusted Latch-less Asynchronous Charge Sharing Logic (LACSL) is developed to inherently defend such architecture against DPA attacks. The proposed logic provides input data independent low-power/energy consumption which is attributed to interleaved charge sharing stages with non-static elements involved in the data path. A 32-bit LACSL Montgomery Multiplier (case study) is extensively tested through HSPICE simulations and great consistency in power/energy consumption is achieved. The normalized energy deviation and normalized standard deviation are only 0.048 and 0.011, respectively. Compared with the original ACSL implementation, besides the impressive energy coherence, 42% energy saving is demonstrated plus that the leakage power is 3.5 times smaller. Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed multiplier is explored where 64bit, 128-bit and 256-bit designs are implemented. Again, great energy consistency is found with the highest deviation being 0.5%. The proposed techniques can be easily migrated to other low-power circuits for which accurate power/energy models can be built, independent of the input data profile. © 2015 IEEE."
19,Graphics Interface Conference,2015,Non-volatility for ultra-low power asynchronous circuits in hybrid CMOS/magnetic technology,"This paper addresses the power reduction techniques for the ultra-low power integrated circuits. We propose to implement non-volatile asynchronous circuits which will have a quasi-zero leakage consumption, almost instant back-up and wake-up time and will be robust to unstable supply environments. This paper presents the implementation of the non-volatile Celement and Half-Buffer, based on hybrid technology incorporating 28nm CMOS FD-SOI and 40nm STT-MRAM magnetic technologies. We discuss our recent simulation results of the proposed non-volatile blocks and aswell more complex structures based on them. We derive the criteria of the implementation efficiency and compare the conventional asynchronous blocks with the proposed non-volatile ones. © 2015 IEEE."
