22,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Circuit and package design for 44GB/s inductive-coupling DRAM/SoC interface,"A 44GB/s inductive-coupling DRAM/SoC interface is developed by PoP integration. It utilizes the advantages of both TSV and LPDDR by using a ThruChip Interface (TCI) and an ultra-thin fan-out wafer level package (UT-FOWLP). The TCI allows data communication between the stacked chips while the UT-FOWLP thins the chips stacking distance and provides the chips with power. This proposed DRAM/SoC interface outperforms WIO2 with TSV in terms of area efficiency (4× better), immunity from simultaneous switching output (SSO) noise (32× better) and manufacturing cost (40% cheaper). In addition, it outperforms LPDDR4 in PoP in terms of power dissipation (5× lower) and timing control easiness. The inductive-coupling interface is newly designed to allow 12× improvement on its area efficiency. By using overlapping coils with quadrature phase division multiplexing (PDM), the coil density is increased by 4 times. The coil density is further increased by 3 times by shortening communication distance with the UT-FOWLP. © 2015 IEEE."
23,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Design and analysis for ThruChip design for manufacturing (DFM),"A 1GB/s ThruChip interface (TCI) test chip for wafer thinning, power mesh, and dummy metal fill impacts are analyzed and evaluated with test chip measurement and field solver simulation. The measurement results show that TCI coil dimension can be sized down as wafer thinning by following D/Z=3 rule. However, the experiment shows 20% power reduction by enlarging TCI coil (D/Z=6). The power mesh lies between TCI coils can dramatically decrease the TCI magnetic pulse strength and hence cause TCI to fail. Dummy metal within TCI coils has no impact on TCI transmission © 2015 IEEE."
24,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A novel approach using a minimum cost maximum flow algorithm for fault-tolerant topology reconfiguration in NoC architectures,"An approach using a minimum cost maximum flow algorithm is proposed for fault-tolerant topology reconfiguration in a Network-on-Chip system. Topology reconfiguration is converted into a network flow problem by constructing a directed graph with capacity constraints. A cost factor is considered to differentiate between processing elements. This approach maximizes the use of spare cores to repair faulty systems, with minimal impact on area, throughput and delay. It also provides a transparent virtual topology to alleviate the burden for operating systems. © 2015 IEEE."
25,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Adaptive remaining hop count flow control: Consider the interaction between packets,"The interaction between packets affects performance and global fairness of Network-on-Chip. Preferentially transferring packets with small remaining hop counts (PPSR) can reduce the flying packet amount to improve the performance. Yet, the global fairness is negatively affected. In contrast, preferentially transferring packets with large remaining hop counts (PPLR) can achieve better global fairness with a poorer performance. In this paper, we propose adaptive remaining hop count flow control, which dynamically switches between PPSR and PPLR. In this way, we can achieve higher performance and better global fairness. © 2015 IEEE."
26,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A flexible hardware barrier mechanism for many-core processors,"This paper proposes a new hardware barrier mechanism which offers the flexibility to select which cores should join the synchronization, allowing for executing multiple multi-threaded applications by dividing a many-core processor into several groups. Experimental results based on an RTL simulation show that our hardware barrier achieves a 66-fold reduction in latency over typical software based implementations, with a hardware overhead of the processor of only 1.8%. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is sufficiently flexible to cover a variety of core groups with minimal hardware overhead. © 2015 IEEE."

28,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A cross-layer framework for designing and optimizing deeply-scaled FinFET-based SRAM cells under process variations,"A cross-layer framework (spanning device and circuit levels) is presented for designing robust and energy-efficient SRAM cells, made of deeply-scaled FinFET devices. In particular, 7nm FinFET devices are designed and simulated by using Synopsys TCAD tool suite, Sentaurus. Next, 6T and 8T SRAM cells, which are composed of these devices, are designed and optimized. To enhance the cell stability and reduce leakage energy consumption, the dual (i.e., front and back) gate control feature of FinFETs is exploited. This is, however, done without requiring any external signal to drive the back gates of the FinFET devices. Subsequently, the effect of process variations on the aforesaid SRAMs is investigated and steps are presented to protect the cells against these variations. More precisely, the SRAM cells are first designed to minimize the expected energy consumption (per clock cycle) subject to the non-destructive read and successful write requirements under worst-case process corner conditions. These SRAM cells, which are overly pessimistic, are then refined by selectively adjusting some transistor sizes, which in turn reduces the expected energy consumption while ensuring that the parametric yield of the cells remains above some prespecified threshold. To do this efficiently, an analytical method for estimating the yield of SRAM cells under process variations is also presented and integrated in the refinement procedure. A dual-gate controlled 6T SRAM cell operating at 324mV (in the near-threshold supply regime) is finally presented as a high-yield and energy-efficient memory cell in the 7nm FinFET technology. © 2015 IEEE."
29,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Controlled placement of standard cell memory arrays for high density and low power in 28nm FD-SOI,"Standard cell memories (SCMs) are becoming a popular alternative to SRAM IPs due to their design flexibility, ease of implementation, and robust operation at low supply voltages. Exclusively composed of standard cells, these memory arrays are implemented as part of the standard digital design flow. However, the synthesis and place and route (P&R) algorithms employed by this flow do not exploit the distinct and regular structure of an SCM array, leaving room for optimization. In this paper, we present a controlled placement design methodology for optimizing the physical implementation of SCM macros, leading to a structured, non-congested layout with close to 100% placement utilization and reduced wirelength as compared to unstructured layouts. Three sample SCM macro sizes were implemented according to the proposed methodology in a state-of-the-art 28nm FD-SOI technology, and compared with equivalent macros designed with the non-controlled, standard flow, achieving as much as a 22% reduction in area, a 57% reduction in switching power, and a 42% reduction in leakage power. In addition, these macros provide as much as an 88% reduction in switching power, as compared to equivalently sized, foundry provided SRAM IPs, while enabling robust functionality well below the minimum operating voltage of these IPs. © 2015 IEEE."
30,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Microarchitectural-level statistical timing models for near-threshold circuit design,"Near-threshold computing has emerged as a promising solution for drastically improving the energy efficiency of microprocessors. This paper proposes architectural-level statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) models for the near-threshold voltage computing where the path delay distribution is approximated as a lognormal distribution. First, we prove several important theorems that help consider architectural design strategies for high performance and energy efficient near-threshold computing. After that, we show the numerical experiments with Monte Carlo simulations using a commercial 28-nm process technology model and demonstrate that the properties presented in the theorems hold for the practical near-threshold logic circuits. © 2015 IEEE."
31,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Stress-aware P/G TSV planning in 3D-ICs,"Power/Ground (P/G) Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) in the Power Distribution Network (PDN) of Three-Dimensional-Integrated-Circuit (3D-IC) have a twofold impact on the delays of the surrounding gates. TSV fabrication causes thermal stress around TSVs, which results in significant carrier mobility variations in their vicinity. On the other hand, the insertion of P/G TSVs will change the voltage of each node in the power grid, which also impacts the delays of the connected gates. Thus, it is necessary to consider the combined effect on delay variation during the P/G TSV planning. In this work, we propose a methodology using Mixed-Integer-Bilinear-Programming (MIBLP) to optimize this delay variation by a refined P/G TSV allocation. Taking into account the impact of thermal stress as well as voltage drop on the circuit delay, we optimally plan the P/G TSVs to minimize the circuit delay for different keep-out zones (KOZs) and PDN pitches. © 2015 IEEE."
32,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,"Quantitative modeling of racetrack memory, a tradeoff among area, performance, and power","Recently, an emerging non-volatile memory called Racetrack Memory (RM) becomes promising to satisfy the requirement of increasing on-chip memory capacity. RM can achieve ultra-high storage density by integrating many bits in a tape-like racetrack, and also provide comparable read/write speed with SRAM. However, the lack of circuit-level modeling has limited the design exploration of RM, especially in the system-level. To overcome this limitation, we develop an RM circuit-level model, with careful study of device configurations and circuit layouts. This model introduces Macro Unit (MU) as the building block of RM, and analyzes the interaction of its attributes. Moreover, we integrate the model into NVsim to enable the automatic exploration of its huge design space. Our case study of RM cache demonstrates significant variance under different optimization targets, in respect of area, performance, and energy. In addition, we show that the cross-layer optimization is critical for adoption of RM as on-chip memory. © 2015 IEEE."

34,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Modeling framework for cross-point resistive memory design emphasizing reliability and variability issues,"Resistive RAM (ReRAM) cross-point memory technology is one of the most promising candidates for future memory designs as it offers small cell area, fast write latency, and excellent scalability. However, it also suffers from more severe reliability issues than other Non-volatile Memory (NVM) technologies. Due to the lack of access device, ReRAM cells cannot be turned off completely and thus write disturbance problem and hard errors can affect the memory array reliability. Moreover, ReRAM cell suffers from temporal variation caused by its stochastic nature, which results in the resistance change. In this paper, pseudo-hard error caused by temporal variation is defined for the first time as a unique type of error in ReRAM cross-point structure. A comprehensive model is proposed to numerically evaluate all kinds of reliability and variability issues including voltage drop, read/write disturbance, spatial/temporal variations, and hard errors. Detailed analysis are presented, and mitigation solutions including dual-port write and test-and-flip strategy are proposed to shed light on reliable ReRAM cross-point memory design. © 2015 IEEE."
35,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A defect-aware approach for mapping reconfigurable Single-Electron Transistor arrays,"Single-Electron Transistor (SET) at room temperature has been demonstrated as a promising device for extending Moore's law due to its ultra low power consumption. However, early realizations of SET array lacked variability and reliability due to their fixed architectures and high defect rates of nanowire segments. Therefore, a reconfigurable version of SET was proposed to deal with these issues. Recently, several automated mapping approaches were proposed for area minimization of reconfigurable SET arrays. However, to the best of our knowledge, no mapping approaches that consider the existence of defective nanowire segments were proposed. Thus, this paper presents the first defect-aware approach for mapping reconfigurable SET arrays. The experimental results show that our approach can successfully map the SET arrays with 20% width overhead on average in the presence of 5000 ppm defects. © 2015 IEEE."
36,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Powering the IoT: Storage-less and converter-less energy harvesting,"Wide spread of Internet of Things (IoTs) still have huddles in cost and maintenance. Energy harvesting is a promising option to mitigate battery replacement, but the current energy harvesting methods still rely on batteries or equivalent and power converters for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Unfortunately, batteries are subject to wear and tear, which is a primary factor to prevent from being maintenance free. Power converters are expensive, heavy and lossy as well. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy harvesting and management technique to power the IoT, which does not require any long-term energy storages nor voltage converters unlike traditional energy harvesting systems. Extensive simulations and measurements from our prototype demonstrate that the proposed method harvests 8% more energy and extends the operation time of the device 60% more during a day. This paper also demonstrates a UV (ultraviolet) level meter for skin protect, named SmartPatch, using the proposed energy harvesting method. The proposed method is not limited to photovoltaic energy harvesting but applicable to most energy harvesting IoT power supplies that require impedance tracking. © 2015 IEEE."
37,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Distributed computing in IoT: System-on-a-chip for smart cameras as an example,"There are four major components in application systems with internet-of-things (IoT): sensors, communications, computation and service, where large amount of data are acquired for ultra-big data analysis to discover the context information and knowledge behind signals. To support such large-scale data size and computation tasks, it is not feasible to employ centralized solutions on cloud servers. Thanks for the advances of silicon technology, the cost of computation become lower, and it is possible to distribute computation on every node in IoT. In this paper, we take video sensing network as an example to show the idea of distributed computing in IoT. Existing related works are reviewed and the architecture of a system-on-a-chip solution for distributed smart cameras is proposed with coarse-grained reconfigurable image stream processing architecture. It can accelerate various computer vision algorithms for distributed smart cameras in IoT. © 2015 IEEE."
38,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Data sensing and analysis: Challenges for wearables,"Wearables are a leading category in the Internet of Things. Compared with mainstream mobile phones, wearables target one order of magnitude form factor reduction, and offer the potential of providing ubiquitous, personalized services to end users. Aggressive reduction in size imposes serious limits on battery capacity. Wearables are equipped with a range of sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. Most economical sensors were developed for mobile phones, with energy consumptions more appropriate for phones than for ultra-compact wearables. This article describes the energy challenges for wearable sensing technologies, with a primary focus on the most widely used wearable sensors: MEMS-based inertial measurement units. Using sports and fitness wearables as the pilot application, we analyze the energy characteristics of MEMS IMU data sensing, analysis, and wireless communication. We then discuss the technologies needed to solve the power and energy consumptions challenges for wearables. © 2015 IEEE."
39,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,ShuttleNoC: Boosting on-chip communication efficiency by enabling localized power adaptation,"Networks-on-Chip (NoC) gradually becomes a main contributor of chip-level power consumption. Due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of on-chip traffic, existing power management approaches cannot adapt the NoC power consumption to its traffic intensity, and hence lead to a suboptimal power efficiency. They either resort to over-provisioned NoC design that only suits for traffic spatial distribution, or coarse-grained power gating that only serves traffic temporal variation. In this paper, we propose a novel NoC architecture called Shuttle Networks-on-Chip (ShuttleNoC). By permitting packets shuttling between multiple subnetworks, localized power adaptation can be achieved. Experimental results show that ShuttleNoC could achieve optimal power efficiency with up to 23.5% power savings and 22.3% performance boost in comparison with traditional heterogeneity-agnostic NoC designs. © 2015 IEEE."
40,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Energy-efficient optical crossbars on chip with multi-layer deposited silicon,"The many cores design research community have shown high interest in optical crossbars on chip for more than a decade. Key properties of optical crossbars, namely a) contention-free data routing b) low-latency communication and c) potential for high bandwidth through the use of WDM, motivate several implementations. These implementations demonstrate very different scalability and power efficiency ability depending on three key design factors: a) the network topology, b) the considered layout and c) the insertion losses induced by the fabrication process. The emerging design technique relying on multi-layer deposited silicon allows reducing optical losses, which may lead to significant reduction of the power consumption. In this paper, multi-layer deposited silicon based crossbars are proposed and compared. The results indicate that the proposed ring-based network exhibits, on average, 22% and 51.4% improvement for worst-case and average losses respectively compared to the most power-efficient related crossbars. © 2015 IEEE."
41,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Two-phase protocol converters for 3D asynchronous 1-of-n data links,"Design of fully synchronous System on Chip is becoming a challenging task. This task is even more difficult in advanced nodes and 3D designs, where the local and global variability can turns the timing closure an overwhelming task. In this way, the use of asynchronous circuits for long link and 3D link communication can provide better robustness to both local and inter-die variability and achieve faster timing closure by extending the Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous style to 3D architectures. However, while the four-phase protocol is well adapted for on chip Delay Insensitive communication, it cannot be adapted for off chip and 3D interface communication due to potential large interface delays. In this paper, we propose the use of two-phase Delay Insensitive Transition Signaling for 1-of-n codes as well as new four 虠 two-phase data converters. The proposed circuitry is able to reduce 20% the dynamic power and improve two times the four-phase throughput for long link communications. © 2015 IEEE."

43,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Nonvolatile memory allocation and hierarchy optimization for high-level synthesis,"The emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technology can potentially change the landscape of future IC designs with numerous benefits, such as high performance, low leakage power, and data retention. These advantages motivate designers to exploit utilizing NVM in in ASIC and FPGA. However, unique challenges such as large write energy and asymmetric read/write operations, lead to extra design knobs. This paper focuses on the NVM allocation and hierarchy optimization in high-level synthesis. A hierarchical hybrid memory architecture is presented. The proposed framework optimizes the memory hierarchy, type (NVM or SRAM) and capacity. Both an mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and a branch-and-bound heuristic are developed. Experimental results demonstrate up to 69.3% power reduction compared with designs without NVM. © 2015 IEEE."
44,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Reverse BDD-based synthesis for splitter-free optical circuits,"With the advancements in silicon photonics, optical devices have found applications e.g. for ultra-high speed and low-power interconnects as well as functional computations to be realized on-chip. Caused by the increasing complexity of the underlying functionality, also the need for computer-aided design methods for this technology rises. Motivated by that, initial work on the development of synthesis methods for optical circuits has been performed. But all approaches proposed thus far suffer e.g. from unsatisfactory synthesis results or restricted scalability. In particular, splittings in the resulting circuits which degrade the optical signals into hardly measurable fractions prevent an efficient and scalable synthesis for optical circuits. In this work, we present a synthesis approach based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) that overcomes these obstacles. The approach yields circuits that rely on a total of zero splitters - at the expense of a moderate increase in the number of optical gates. Experiments confirm that, by this, an efficient and scalable synthesis scheme for optical circuits eventually becomes available. © 2015 IEEE."
45,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Determining the minimal number of swap gates for multi-dimensional nearest neighbor quantum circuits,"Motivated by the promises of significant speed-ups for certain problems, quantum computing received significant attention in the past. While much progress has been made in the development of synthesis methods for quantum circuits, new physical developments constantly lead to new constraints to be addressed. The limited interaction distance between the respective qubits (i.e. nearest neighbor optimization) has already been considered intensely. But with the emerge of multi-dimensional quantum architectures, new physical requirements came up for which only a few automatic synthesis solutions exist yet all of them of heuristic nature. In this work, we propose an exact scheme for nearest neighbor optimization in multi-dimensional quantum circuits. Although the complexity of the problem is a serious obstacle, our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed solution is sufficient to allow for a qualitative evaluation of the respective optimization steps. Besides that, this enabled an exact comparison to heuristical results for the first time. © 2015 IEEE."
46,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Design and optimization of 3D digital microfluidic biochips for the polymerase chain reaction,"A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for revolutionizing immunoassays, clinical diagnostics, drug discovery, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures in biochemistry. In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA segments. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) DMFBs that integrate photodetectors (i.e., cyberphysical DMFBs) have been developed. They offer the benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity and quicker time-to-results. However, current DMFB design methods target optimization in only two dimensions, hence they ignore the 3D two-layer structure of a DMFB. Moreover, these techniques ignore practical constraints related to the interference between on-chip device pairs, the performance-critical PCR thermal loop, and the physical size of devices. In this paper, we describe an optimization solution for a 3D DMFB, and present a three-stage algorithm to realize a compact 3D PCR chip layout, which includes: (i) PCR thermal-loop optimization; (ii) 3D global placement based on Strong-Push-Weak-Pull (SPWP) model; (iii) constraint-aware legalization. Simulation results for four laboratory protocols demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for the design and optimization of a 3D chip for real-time PCR. © 2015 IEEE."

In this paper, we applied triple patterning lithography on standard cell based designs, and proposed a novel algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm guarantees to find a legal TPL decomposition with optimal number of stitches if one exists. A graph model is proposed to reduce the number of vertices in the solution graph, and a fast approach is developed to achieve simultaneous runtime and memory improvement. An efficient approach to limit the number of stitches is also proposed, which greatly reduces the total number of stitch candidates and enables an incremental implementation of the algorithm. Experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm is very efficient, which achieves 39.1% runtime improvement and 18.4% memory reduction compared with the state-of-the-art TPL algorithm on the same problem. © 2015 IEEE."
51,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Gate sizing and threshold voltage assignment for high performance microprocessor designs,"Timing-constrained power-driven gate sizing has aroused lot of research interest after the recent two discrete gate sizing contests organized by International Symposium on Physical Design. Since then, there are plenty of research papers published and new algorithms are proposed based on the ISPD 2013 contest formulation. However, almost all (new and old) papers in the literature ignore the details of how power-driven gate sizing fits in industrial physical synthesis flows, which limits their practical usage. This paper aims at filling this knowledge gap. We explain our approach to integrate a state-of-the-art Lagrangian Relaxation-based gate sizing into our actual physical synthesis framework, and explain the challenges and issues we observed from the point of view of VLSI design flows. © 2015 IEEE."
52,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Analytical placement for rectilinear blocks,"This paper proposes a fast analytical placement for rectilinear blocks. The LSI production method is also improved. As a result, there are much large number of elements on one chip. On the other hand, its turn-around-time is same as or less than those of the previous designs. To solve this difficulty, the reuse of the designed modules, that is, IPs, is promising. However, the LSI production improvement also leads larger numbers of IPs, while the shape of IP seems to be rectilinear. Thus, a fast analytical placement for rectilinear blocks is needed. In this paper, we enhance Overlap-Removable Length which has been introduced to the rectangle block placement to rectilinear block placement. We show the efficiency of the proposed method empirically. © 2015 IEEE."
53,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,IR to routing challenge and solution for interposer-based design,"A novel IR-aware chip and interposer co-design methodology is presented to handle both chip-interposer routing and micro-bump planning for IR drops. Based on bump rules and power information in a chip, the methodology analyzes the locations of micro bumps to meet IR constraints. For chip-interposer routing, the computational geometry techniques (e.g., Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram) are applied to a network-flow formulation for minimizing both IR drops and total wirelength. With the chip and interposer co-design flow, IR constraints can be met with 100% chip-interposer routing completion. Experimental results based on industry designs demonstrate the high-quality of our algorithm. © 2015 IEEE."
54,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Aging mitigation in memory arrays using self-controlled bit-flipping technique,"With CMOS technology downscaling into the nanometer regime, the reliability of SRAM memories is threatened by accelerated transistor aging mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI). BTI leads to a considerable degradation of SRAM cell Static Noise Margin (SNM), which increases the memory failure rate. Since BTI is workload dependent, the aging rates of different cells in a memory array are quite non-uniform. To address this issue, a variety of bit-flipping techniques has been proposed to decrease the SNM degradation by balancing the signal probabilities of the cells. However, existing bit-flipping techniques impose too much area and power overhead as at least an additional column is required to store the inversion flags. In this paper, we propose a low cost self-controlled bit-flipping technique which inverts all bit positions with respect to an existing bit. This technique is applied to a register-file and cache units of an embedded microprocessor. Our simulation results show that the reliability of the proposed technique is similar to that of existing bit-flipping techniques, while imposing 64% less area overhead. © 2015 IEEE."
55,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Design methodology for approximate accumulator based on statistical error model,"Approximate computing technology has aroused growing interest in circuit and system design for its well-performed trade-off between output quality and performance. Numerous basic circuits and system design methodologies for approximate computing have been proposed. Considering that the existing methodologies for the evaluation of tradeoff between output quality and performance is time-consuming, this paper presents a fast design methodology for approximate accumulator based on statistical error model, in which the inexact multistage speculative adder is adopted and modeled for its advantage of compact error pattern. To validate the proposed methodology, Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm is analyzed and mapped to a hardware system composed of inexact and accurate computing circuits. Results show that our time for searching the optimal mapping circuits has been saved by 22.08% than functional-based simulation where the final approximate system design achieves 1.57× speedups with 8.56% accuracy degradation. © 2015 IEEE."
56,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Multiple Independent Gate FETs: How many gates do we need?,"Multiple Independent Gate Field Effect Transistors (MIGFETs) are expected to push FET technology further into the semiconductor roadmap. In a MIGFET, supplementary gates either provide (i) enhanced conduction properties or (ii) more intelligent switching functions. In general, each additional gate also introduces a side implementation cost. To enable more efficient digital systems, MIGFETs must leverage their expressive power to realize complex logic circuits with few physical resources. Researchers face then the question: How many gates do we need? In this paper, we address the logic side of this question. We determine whether or not an increasing number of gates leads to more compact logic implementations. For this purpose, we develop a logic synthesis flow that intrinsically exploits a MIGFET switching function. Using simplified design assumptions and device/interconnect models, we synthesize MCNC benchmarks on 5 promising MIGFET devices, with number of gates ranging from 1 to 7. Experimental results evidence nontrivial area/delay/energy minima, located between 1 and 4 gates, depending on a MIGFET switching function and device/interconnect technology. © 2015 IEEE."

60,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Many-to-many active cell balancing strategy design,"In the context of active cell balancing of electric vehicle battery cells, we deal with circuit architectures for inductor-based charge transfer and the corresponding high-level modeling and strategy development. In this work, we introduce a circuit architecture to transfer charge between arbitrarily many source and destination cells (many-to-many) for the first time and analyze the advantages over one-to-one transfer. Balancing simulation with numerical solvers remains challenging because of non-differentiable PWM signals, while the search space for high-level strategy design - crucial for time and energy efficiency - becomes even larger. Consequently, we develop a closed-form charge transfer model that extends state-of-the-art approaches and is three orders of magnitude faster than step-size controlled simulation. With an initial algorithm design based on experimentally derived rules, we demonstrate that many-to-many transfer dominates neighbor-only approaches in speed and efficiency even though it requires only one additional switch per circuit module. © 2015 IEEE."
61,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Intra-vehicle network routing algorithm for wiring weight and wireless transmit power minimization,"As the complexity of vehicular distributed systems increases rapidly, several hundreds of devices (sensors, actuators, etc.) are being placed in a modern automotive system. With the increase in wiring cables connecting these devices, the weight of a car increases significantly, which degrades the fuel efficiency in driving. In order to reduce the weight of a car, wireless communication has been introduced to replace wiring cables between some devices. However, the extra energy consumption for packet transmissions by wireless devices requires frequent maintenance, e.g., recharging of batteries. In this paper, we propose an intra-vehicle network routing algorithm to simultaneously minimize the wiring weight and the transmit power for wireless communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively minimize the wiring weight and the transmit power for wireless communication. © 2015 IEEE."

Since nanometer VLSI design and manufacturing have extremely high complexity and gigantic data, there has been a surge recently in applying and adapting machine learning and pattern matching techniques in VLSI physical design (including physical verification), e.g., lithography hotspot detection and data/pattern-driven physical design, as ML and PM can raise the level of abstraction from detailed physics-based simulations and provide reasonably good quality-of-result.

65,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Self-learning and adaptive board-level functional fault diagnosis,"Functional fault diagnosis is necessary for board-level product qualification. However, ambiguous diagnosis results can lead to long debug times and wrong repair actions, which significantly increase repair cost and adversely impact yield. A state-of-the-art functional fault diagnosis system involves several key components: (1) design of functional test programs, (2) collection of functional-failure syndromes, (3) building of the diagnosis engine, (4) isolation of root causes, and (5) evaluation of the diagnosis engine. Advances in each of these components can pave the way for a more effective diagnosis system, thus improving diagnosis accuracy and reducing diagnosis time. Machine-learning and data analysis techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to develop an automated and adaptive diagnosis system to increase diagnosis accuracy and reduce diagnosis time. This paper describes how all the above components of an advanced diagnosis system can benefit from machine learning and information theory. Topics discussed include incremental learning, decision trees, root-cause analysis and evaluation metrics, data acquisition, and knowledge transfer. © 2015 IEEE."
66,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Fast statistical analysis of rare failure events for memory circuits in high-dimensional variation space,"Accurately estimating the rare failure rates for nanoscale memory circuits is a challenging task, especially when the variation space is high-dimensional. In this paper, we summarize two novel techniques to address this technical challenge. First, we describe a subset simulation (SUS) technique to estimate the rare failure rates for continuous performance metrics. The key idea of SUS is to express the rare failure probability of a given circuit as the product of several large conditional probabilities by introducing a number of intermediate failure events. These conditional probabilities can be efficiently estimated with a set of Markov chain Monte Carlo samples generated by a modified Metropolis algorithm. Second, to efficiently estimate the rare failure rates for discrete performance metrics, scaled-sigma sampling (SSS) can be used. SSS aims to generate random samples from a distorted probability distribution for which the standard deviation (i.e., sigma) is scaled up. Next, the failure rate is accurately estimated from these scaled random samples by using an analytical model derived from the theorem of 'soft maximum'. Our experimental results of several nanoscale circuit examples demonstrate that SUS and SSS achieve significantly improved accuracy over other traditional techniques when the dimensionality of the variation space is more than a few hundred. © 2015 IEEE."

Nonvolatile (NV) register based processor is proposed to realize fast resume after power failure. The states in the volatile registers are checkpointed to NV registers. However, frequent checkpointing causes performance degradation and consumes excessive power. In this paper, we propose the checkpoint aware instruction scheduling (CAIS) algorithm to reduce the writes to NV registers. Experiments show that CAIS can improve performance and reduce power consumption. © 2015 IEEE."
69,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Balloonfish: Utilizing morphable resistive memory in mobile virtualization,"Virtualization offers significant benefits such as better isolation and security for mobile systems. However, the limited amount of memory and virtualization's memory-demanding nature makes it challenging to virtualize mobile systems efficiently. In this paper, we utilize morphable resistive memories to design a high-performance mobile system with extensible memory space. With morphable resistive memory, we convert the memory cell state between multi-level and single-level to achieve a balance between performance and memory space. Our evaluation based on the Samsung Exynos 5250 SoC with real Android applications shows that our system achieve 27% performance improvement compared with the baseline scheme. © 2015 IEEE."
70,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A three-stage-write scheme with flip-bit for PCM main memory,"Phase-change memory (PCM) is a nonvolatile memory which suffers slow write performance and limited write endurance. Besides, writing a one to a PCM cell needs longer time but less electrical current than writing a zero. In traditional PCM schemes, zeros and ones in a word are written at the same time and word write time has to be the time to write a one, thus incurring time waste. In this paper, we propose a three-stage write scheme with flip-bit for PCM main memory to reduce the number of changed bits and write latency. In our scheme, write operation is divided into comparison, write-0 and write-1 stages. In the comparison stage, new data and old data are compared and the new data is re-encoded by a flip-bit to minimize changed bits. Then the flip-bit and re-encoded data are written to PCM cells in an accelerating manner. All zero bits and one bits are written separately in later two stages to avoid the time waste in traditional write. Our scheme shrinks time consumption and reduces bit changes caused by write operation over other existing schemes. The experimental results show that this scheme decreases 43.5% bit changes, 16.6% write time and 34.6% write energy consumption on average. © 2015 IEEE."
71,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A Garbage Collection Aware Stripping method for Solid-State Drives,"The stripping method has been widely used to serve the requests simultaneously in Solid-State Drive (SSD). Although most of the stripping methods can improve the I/O performance of SSD, they will also result in the asymmetric distribution of the requests between the logical space and physical space, This will induce extra garbage collection operations, and will affect both of the endurance and the I/O performance of SSDs. This paper presents Garbage Collection Aware Stripping (GCAS), a novel stripping method that considers the efficiency of garbage collection for NAND flash memory based SSDs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly optimizes garbage collection operation and the I/O performance of stripping methods in NAND flash memory based SSDs. We implemented GCAS on a real hardware platform. Experiments show that GCAS can achieve a 15.87% reduction in terms of the number of the block erase count and can reduce 47.6% worst-case response time compared with a representative stripping method. © 2015 IEEE."
72,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Unified non-volatile memory and NAND flash memory architecture in smartphones,"I/O is becoming one of major performance bottlenecks in NAND-flash-based smartphones. Novel NVMs (nonvolatile memories), such as PCM (Phase Change Memory) and STT-RAM (Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory), can provide fast read/write operations. In this paper, we propose an unified NVM/flash architecture to improve the I/O performance. A transparent scheme, vFlash (Virtualized Flash), is also proposed to manage the unified architecture. Within vFlash, inter-app technique is proposed to optimize the application performance by exploiting the historic locality of applications. Since vFlash is on the bottom of the I/O stack, the application features will be lost. Therefore, we also propose a cross-layer technique to transfer the application information from the application layer to the vFlash layer. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on a real Android platform, and the experimental results show that the read and write performance for the proposed scheme is 2.45 times and 3.37 times better than that of the stock Android 4.2 system, respectively. © 2015 IEEE."
73,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A retargetable and accurate methodology for logic-IP-internal electromigration assessment,"A new methodology for SoC-level logic-IP-internal EM verification is presented, which provides an on-the-fly retargeting capability for reliability constraints. This flexibility is available at the design verification stage, in the form of allowing arbitrary specifications (of lifetimes, temperatures, voltages and failure rates), as well as interoperability of IPs across foundries. The methodology is characterization- and reuse-based, and naturally incorporates complex effects such as clock gating and variable switching rates at different pins. The benefit from such a framework is demonstrated on a 28nm design, with close SPICE-correlation and verification in a retargeted reliability condition. © 2015 IEEE."
74,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,New electromigration modeling and analysis considering time-varying temperature and current densities,"Electromigration (EM) is projected to be the major reliability issue for current and future VLSI technologies. However, existing EM models and assessment techniques are mainly based on the constant current density and temperature. Such models will not work well at the system level as the current density (power) and temperature are changing with time due to different tasks (their loans) applied at run time. Existing EM approaches using average current density or temperature, however, will lead to significant errors as shown in this work. In this paper, we propose a new physics-based EM model considering time-varying temperature and current density, which reflects a more practical chip working conditions especially for multi-core and emerging 3D ICs. We study the impacts of the time-varying current densities and temperature profiles on EM-induced lifetime of a wire for both nucleation phase and growth phase. We propose a fast stress calculation method for given time-varying temperature and current densities for the nucleation phase. We further develop new formulae to compute the resistance changes in growth phase due to changing temperature and current densities. Experimental results show that the proposed method shows an excellent agreement with the detailed numerical analysis but with much improved efficiency. © 2015 IEEE."
75,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Generating circuit current constraints to guarantee power grid safety,"Efficient and early verification of the chip power distribution network is a critical step in modern IC design. Vectorless verification, developed over the last decade as an alternative to simulation based methods, requires user-specified current constraints and checks if the corresponding worst-case voltage drops at all grid nodes are below user-specified thresholds. However, obtaining/specifying the current constraints remains a burdensome task for design teams. In this paper, we define and address the inverse problem: for a given grid, we will generate circuit current constraints which, if adhered to by the underlying logic, would guarantee grid safety. There are many potential applications for this approach, including various grid quality metrics, as well as power grid-aware placement and floorplanning. We give a rigorous problem definition and develop some key theoretical results related to maximality of the current space defined by the constraints. Based on this, we then develop two algorithms for constraints generation that target key quality metrics like the peak total power allowed by the grid and the uniformity of the temperature distribution. © 2015 IEEE."
76,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,BEE: Predicting realistic worst case and stochastic eye diagrams by accounting for correlated bitstreams and coding strategies,"Modern high-speed links and I/O subsystems often employ sophisticated coding strategies to boost error resilience and achieve multi-Gb/s throughput. The end-to-end analysis of such systems, which involves accurate prediction of worst-case and stochastic eye diagrams, is a challenging problem. Existing techniques such as Peak Distortion Analysis (PDA) typically predict overly pessimistic eye diagrams because they do not take into account the coding strategies employed. Monte-Carlo methods, on the other hand, often predict overly optimistic eye diagrams, and they are also very time-consuming. As an alternative, we present BEE, an accurate and efficient computational technique that applies dynamic programming algorithms to predict realistic worst-case and stochastic eye diagrams in modern high-speed links and I/O subsystems - with neither excessive pessimism nor undue optimism. BEE is able to fully and correctly take into account many features underlying modern communications systems, including arbitrary high-level transmit-side coding schemes and strategies, as well as various low-level non-idealities introduced by the underlying channel(s), such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk, asymmetric rise/fall times, jitter, parameter variability, etc. Furthermore, BEE accurately captures the fact that different received bits typically have widely different eye diagrams when a channel is driven by correlated bitstreams generated by coding strategies. We demonstrate BEE on links involving (7,4)-Hamming and 8b/10b SERDES encoders, featuring channels that give rise to multiple reflections, dispersion, loss, and overshoot/undershoot. BEE successfully predicts actual worst case eye openings in all these real-world systems, which can be twice as large as the eye openings predicted by overly pessimistic methods like PDA. Also, BEE can be an order of magnitude faster (and much more reliable) than Monte-Carlo based eye estimation methods. © 2015 IEEE."
77,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A fast parallel approach for common path pessimism removal,"Static timing analysis has always been indispensable in integrated circuit design. In order to consider design and electrical complexities (e.g., crosstalk coupling, voltage drops) as well as manufacturing and environmental variations, timing analysis is typically done using an 'early-late' split. The early-late split timing analysis enables timers to effectively account for any within-chip variation effects. However, this dual-mode analysis may introduce unnecessary pessimism, which can lead to an over-conservative design. Thus, common path pessimism removal (CPPR) is introduced to eliminate this pessimism during timing analysis. A naive approach would require the analysis of all paths in the design. For today's designs with millions of gates, enumerating all paths is impractical. In this paper, we propose a new approach to effectively prune the redundant paths and develop a multi-threaded timing analysis tool called MTimer for fast and accurate CPPR. The results show that our timer can achieve 3.53X speedup on average comparing with the winner of the TAU 2014 contest and maintain 100% accuracy on removing common path pessimism during timing analysis. © 2015 IEEE."
78,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Detailed-Routing-Driven analytical standard-cell placement,"Due to the significant mismatch between global-routing congestions estimated during placement and the resulting design-rule violations in detailed routing, considering both global and detailed routability during placement is of particular importance for modern circuit designs. This paper presents an analytical standard-cell placement algorithm to optimize detailed routability with three major techniques: (1) A routability-driven wirelength model that directly minimizes routing congestion and wirelength simultaneously with no additional computational overhead in global placement. (2) A detailed-routability-aware whitespace allocation technique in legalization. (3) A multi-stage congestion-aware cell spreading method in detailed placement. Compared with the participating teams of the 2014 ISPD Detailed-Routing-Driven Placement Contest and a state-of-the-art routability-driven placer, our placer achieves the best quality in both detailed-routing violation and wirelength scores. © 2015 IEEE."
79,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,An approach to anchoring and placing high performance custom digital designs,"Custom layouts of digital blocks are often used in mixed-signal designs in order to meet the critical performance requirements. Unlike traditional standard-cell based digital placement, custom-cell based digital placement may need additional manual help and intervention to achieve higher performance. The need for manual intervention is primarily due to the inability of modern analytical placers in delivering satisfactory performance on placing designs without pre-placed blocks. While most design flow works in a flat or top-down fashion, custom digital design generally works in a bottom-up fashion that there is no prior knowledge on I/O pin plan since it is changeable by the owners of modules. Without any or very few fixed I/O locations, modern analytical placers tend to produce unsatisfactory results. In this work, we propose a method, mimicking the process of making beds, to guide state-of-the-art analytical placers to deliver better placement results. With the crafted pseudo anchors and nets, total HPWL on Capo10.5 [1], mPL6 [2], NTUplace3 [3] and VDAPlace [4] have improved by 2.92%, 8.69%, 25.26% and 10.72% respectively on a set of industry custom digital designs and improved by 2.19%, 4.34%, 36.09%, and 14.27% respectively on Peko-Suite1 benchmarks. © 2015 IEEE."
80,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Non-stitch triple patterning-aware routing based on conflict graph pre-coloring,"Considering decomposition constraints earlier during routing becomes critical for realizing triple patterning lithography. In addition, stitches typically cause significant yield loss because of the overlay errors among different masks. As a result, leading foundries even get rid of the use of stitches in their design methodology. In order to completely avoid stitch-induced yield loss, we address the non-stitch triple patterning-aware routing problem. We observe that directly extending a state-of-the-art triple patterning-aware routing work to non-stitch routing might generate improper self-crossing nets and degrade routing quality due to sequential coloring for mask selection. To resolve these problems, we propose a new graph model to prevent self-crossing nets during routing and use a weighted conflict graph to globally consider net coloring. We then propose the first non-stitch triple patterning-aware routing scheme, which consists of two main stages: (1) conflict graph pre-coloring followed by (2) pre-coloring-based non-stitch routing. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our routing scheme. © 2015 IEEE."

To realize such applications using image recognition algorithm as hard real-time task with low power consumption, we have developed heterogeneous multi-core SoC specialized for image recognition [1]. Subsequently, several image recognition applications have been developed using this SoC.

The results of the evaluation show that the SoC allows these applications to run with significantly low power consumption comparing with general purpose CPU. © 2015 IEEE."

86,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Multilane Racetrack caches: Improving efficiency through compression and independent shifting,"Racetrack memory (RM), a spintronic domain-wall non-volatile memory has recently received attention as a high-capacity replacement for various structures in the memory system from secondary storage through caches. The main advantage of RM is an improved density and like other non-volatile memory structures, the static power of RM is dramatically lower than conventional CMOS memories. However, a major challenge of employing RM in universal memory components is the added access latency and dynamic energy consumption caused by shifts to align the data of interest with an access port. We propose multilane Racetrack caches (MRC), a RM last level cache design utilizing lightweight compression combined with independent shifting. MRC allows cache lines mapped to the same Racetrack structure to be accessed in parallel when compressed, mitigating potential shifting stalls in the RM cache. Our results demonstrate that unlike previously proposed RM caches, an isocapacity MRC cache replacement can outperform SRAM caches while providing energy improvement over STT-MRAM caches. In particular, MRC improves performance by 5% and reduces energy by 19% compared to an isocapacity baseline RM cache resulting in an energy delay product improvement of 25%. © 2015 IEEE."
87,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Managing hybrid on-chip scratchpad and cache memories for multi-tasking embedded systems,"On-chip memory management is essential in design of high performance and energy-efficient embedded systems. While many off-the-shelf embedded processors employ a hybrid on-chip SRAM architecture including both scratchpad memories (SPMs) and caches, many existing work on SPM management ignore the synergy between caches and SPMs. In this work, we propose a static SPM allocation strategy for the hybrid on-chip memory architecture in a multi-tasking environment, which minimizes the overall access latency and energy consumption of the instruction memory subsystem. We capture cache conflict misses via a fine-grained temporal cache behavior model. An integer linear programming (ILP) based formulation is proposed to generate an function-level SPM allocation scheme, where both intra- and inter-task cache interference as well as access frequency are captured for an optimal memory subsystem design. Compared with the state-of-the-art static SPM allocation strategy in a multitasking environment, experimental results show that our SPM management scheme achieves 30.51% further improvement in instruction memory subsystem performance, and up to 34.92% in terms of energy saving. © 2015 IEEE."
88,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Optimizing thread-to-core mapping on manycore platforms with distributed Tag Directories,"With the increasing demand for parallel computing power, manycore platforms are attracting more and more attention due to their potential to improve performance and scalability of parallel applications. However, as the core count increases, core-to-core communication becomes expensive. For manycore architectures using directory-based cache coherence protocols, the core-to-core communication latency depends not only on the physical placement on the chip, but also on the location of the distributed cache tag directory. In this paper, we first define the concept of core distance for multicore and manycore architectures. Using a ping-pong spin-lock benchmark, we quantify the core distance on a ring-network platform and propose an approach to optimize thread-to-core mapping in order to minimize on-chip communication overhead. In our experiments, our approach speeds up communication-intensive benchmarks by more than 25% on average over the Linux default mapping strategy. © 2015 IEEE."

In this paper we propose a novel algorithm to find the optimal macromodel that minimizes the modeling error based on measurement data, while simultaneously guaranteeing passivity. The key idea is to attack the passive macromodeling problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems. As such, the proposed method can iteratively find the optimal poles and zeros for macromodeling. Our experimental results with several commercial RF circuit examples demonstrate that the proposed macromodeling method reduces the modeling error by 1.31-2.74× over other conventional approaches. © 2015 IEEE."
91,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Physical verification flow for hierarchical analog ic design constraints,"Design constraints describe the intent of IC designers when developing electronic circuits. Constraints from, e.g., electrical and thermal domains are transformed into corresponding physical constraints for layout design. Physical constraints can also be derived from circuit patterns or extracted layout netlists. The constraint verification is of utmost importance to guarantee the intended function of the final IC. Individual constraints often span multiple hierarchy levels, thus requiring a fully hierarchical verification approach. A novel, modular, and extensible industrial-strength approach is presented to (1) derive analog-focused design constraints from an existing circuit or extracted layout netlist, and (2) verify analog constraints such as clustering, matched orientation, matched parameters, alignment, and symmetry across multiple design hierarchy levels. Experimental results for real-world automotive IC designs demonstrate its feasibility. © 2015 IEEE."
92,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Automatic design for analog/RF front-end system in 802.11ac receiver,"Although automatic optimization for individual analog/RF modules has been studied for many years, design automation for analog/RF systems that contain a complicated hierarchy of mixed-signal modules is still very challenging as the lack of an efficient way to bridge between different level descriptions in the design hierarchy. In this paper, we applied sparse regression as a modeling tool to model the modules that need to be optimized and embedded the modules in a large system to accomplish a realistic 802.11ac system design. The wireless system specification (e.g. bit error rate) for comprehensively evaluating the analog/RF front-ends is used as the optimization objective. The proposed method is implemented by linking the block-level performance metrics to the wireless system using mixed-signal simulation platform with performance modeling and Pareto optimal fronts. By this method, the receiver for 802.11ac systems is successfully designed and the worst error vector magnitude (EVM) is decreased by 34% from coarse design. © 2015 IEEE."
93,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,SIPredict: Efficient post-layout waveform prediction via System Identification,"In this paper, we propose a post-layout waveform prediction method by System Identification (SI) based on the fact that the waveforms of pre-layout and post-layout are always correlated. Mathematical models are built to describe the relationships between the pre-layout and post-layout simulation results via SI techniques. The model parameters are calibrated by using the simulation results of the first few data points of pre-layout and post-layout stages. By taking the corresponding pre-layout simulation results as inputs of the calibrated models, the rest post-layout waveforms can thus be predicted as the output of the models. Several examples demonstrate the efficiency of the prediction, which helps the designers have a quick view of the post-layout waveforms in the design process. © 2015 IEEE."
94,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Useful clock skew scheduling using adjustable delay buffers in multi-power mode designs,"Contrary to the bounded clock skew scheduling, which controls the clock signal arrival times of flip-flops (FFs) so that all clock skews are within a given bound, the useful clock skew scheduling exploits the time borrowing between signal paths by controlling the clock times in a way to meet the timing constraints of the individual signal paths, thus enabling a further improvement of clock frequency. However, even though there are many works on the useful clock skew scheduling, most of them are targeted to designs with single power mode. This work addresses the problem of useful clock skew scheduling for designs with multiple power modes, which is nowadays an essential concept for low-power designs. Precisely, we propose an optimal solution of the problem of useful clock skew scheduling for designs of multiple power modes with the objective of minimizing the number of adjustable delay buffers (ADBs) used. In addition, we solve two practical extensions: optimally allocating ADBs having quantized delay values and optimally allocating ADBs with delay upper bound. The experiments with benchmark circuits show that our proposed algorithm reduces the number of ADBs by 14.0% on average over the results produced by the conventional ADB allocation of useful clock skew scheduling for designs with multiple power modes, and reduces the number of ADBs by 77.3% on average over that produced by the previous optimal ADB allocation of bounded clock skew scheduling for designs with multiple power modes. © 2015 IEEE."
95,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Fast clock skew scheduling based on sparse-graph algorithms,"Incorporating timing constraints explicitly imposed by the data and control paths during clock network synthesis can enhance the robustness of the synthesized clock networks. With these constraints, a clock scheduler can be used to guide the synthesis of a clock network by specifying a set of feasible arrival times at the respective sequential elements. Clock scheduling can be either static or dynamic. In static clock scheduling, a clock schedule is first specified; next, a clock network is constructed realizing the prescribed schedule. Clock trees constructed using this approach may consume significant routing resources. In dynamic clock scheduling, the clock tree and clock schedule are both simultaneously constructed and determined, respectively. In earlier studies, the scalability of dynamic clock scheduling, which is essentially a shortest path problem, has been limited. The bottleneck is in finding the shortest paths between different vertices in an incrementally changing weighted graph. In this work, we present two clock schedulers that address the scalability issues by exploiting the sparsity of this weighted graph. Experimental results show that the proposed clock schedulers are one to two orders of magnitude faster compared to a published scheduler in an earlier work. The proposed clock schedulers are scalable, and are tested on a synthesized circuit with 348 710 cells, 57 491 sequential elements, and 496 727 explicit timing constraints. © 2015 IEEE."
96,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Modeling and optimization of low power resonant clock mesh,"Power consumption is becoming more critical in modern integrated circuit (IC) designs and clock network is one of the major contributors for on-chip power. Resonant clock has been investigated as a potential solution to reduce the power consumption in clock network by recycling the energy with on-chip inductors. Most of the previous resonant clock work focuses on H-tree structures, while in this work, we propose a modeling and optimization method for the mesh structure, which suffers from the high power consumption more seriously than the tree structure. Closed-form expressions for the transfer function, skew, and power are derived. Based on these expressions, impacts of design factors, such as the buffer size, LC tank location, grid size, wire width, and the sparsity of buffers and LC tanks, are fully explored to make trade-offs among power, skew, and area, which can be used as design guidelines for top level resonant clock mesh in early design stages. The exploration is also extended to 3D ICs and different mesh structures are evaluated. Matlab-based implementation of the proposed simplified circuit model can achieve over 105 times speedup compared to SPICE-based simulation. © 2015 IEEE."
97,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Synthesis of resonant clock networks supporting dynamic voltage / frequency scaling,"The portion of clock power in system is rapidly increasing with the continuous increasing of clock frequency and clock resources. Last two decades, a great research attention has been paid to minimizing the clock power. Recently, it is shown that the structure of resonant clock networks is very effective in saving power since it can store electric energy to the inserted inductors rather than dissipate. On the other side, it has been known that dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) is one of the most effectively and widely used power reduction techniques. However, so far no works have addressed the problem of synthesizing resonant clock networks that are able to operate under the designs with DVFS capability even though the problem is potentially very important to maximize the synergy effect on saving power. In this context, this work proposes a comprehensive solution to the problem. Precisely, we propose a two-phase synthesis algorithm: (1) formulating the problem of inductor allocation, placement, and adjustable-sizing to support DVFS into a weighted set cover problem with the objective of minimizing total area of inductors followed by (2) performing the task of resizing of adjustable driving buffers to support the switch of driving strength according to the clock frequencies by DVFS. Through experiments with benchmark circuits, it is shown that for designs with DVFS using 1GHz and 3GHz, our algorithm synthesizes resonant clock networks with 17% less power on the execution of the clock frequency, which is not supported by resonant clocking in the previous no-DVFS aware resonant clock synthesis algorithm. © 2015 IEEE."
98,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,An efficient STT-RAM-based register file in GPU architectures,"Modern GPGPUs employ a large register file (RF) to efficiently process heavily parallel threads in single instruction multiple thread (SIMT) fashion. The up-scaling of RF capacity, however, is greatly constrained by large cell area and high leakage power consumption of SRAM implementation. In this work, we propose a novel GPU RF design based on the emerging multi-level cell (MLC) spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) technology. Compared to SRAM, MLC STT-RAM (or MLC-STT) has much smaller cell area and almost zero standby power due to its non-volatility. Moreover, by leveraging the asymmetric performance of the soft and the hard bits of a MLC-STT cell, we propose a remapping strategy to perform a flexible tradeoff between the access time and the capacity of the RF based on run-time access patterns. A novel rescheduling scheme is also developed to minimize the waiting time of the issued warps to access register banks. Experimental results over ISPASS2009 and CUDA benchmarks show that on average, our proposed MLC-STT RF can achieve 3.28% performance improvement, 9.48% energy reduction, and 38.9% energy efficiency enhancement compared to conventional SRAM-based design. © 2015 IEEE."
99,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A bit-write reduction method based on error-correcting codes for non-volatile memories,"Non-volatile memory has many advantages over SRAM. However, one of its largest problems is that it consumes a large amount of energy in writing. In this paper, we propose a bit-write reduction method based on error correcting codes for non-volatile memories. When a data is written into a memory cell, we do not write it directly but encode it into a codeword. We focus on error-correcting codes and generate new codes called write-reduction codes. In our write-reduction codes, each data corresponds to an information vector in an error-correcting code and an information vector corresponds not to a single codeword but a set of write-reduction codewords. Given a writing data and current memory bits, we can deterministically select a particular write-reduction codeword corresponding to a data to be written, where the maximum number of flipped bits are theoretically minimized. Then the number of writing bits into memory cells will also be minimized. We perform several experimental evaluations and demonstrate up to 72% energy reduction. © 2015 IEEE."
100,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Minimizing MLC PCM write energy for free through profiling-based state remapping,"Phase change memory is becoming one of the most promising candidates to replace DRAM as main memory in deep sub-micron regime. Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM outperforms single level cell (SLC) PCM in terms of storage capacity but requires an iterative programming-and-verifying scheme to program cells to different resistance levels. The energy consumed in programming different MLC states varies significantly, thus motivating a state remapping technique to minimize the overall write energy. In this paper, we first compare dynamic and static state remapping strategies in terms of their efficacy in reducing energy, and then propose an effective and low-cost static state remapping algorithm. The experimental studies show 10.6% average (up to 16.9%) reduction in MLC PCM write energy, achieved within negligible hardware and performance overhead. Compared with the most related work, the proposed scheme saves more write energy on average, with near-zero performance, area and energy overhead. © 2015 IEEE."
101,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Improving performance and lifetime of DRAM-PCM hybrid main memory through a proactive page allocation strategy,"Phase change memory (PCM), given its non-volatility and low static energy consumption, is a promising candidate to be used as main memory. However, due to its limited endurance and slow write performance, state-of-the-art solutions tend to construct a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory instead of using PCM exclusively. While existing optimizations to this hybrid architecture focus on tuning DRAM configurations to further reduce writes to PCM, we aim at developing a proactive solution. Specifically, we exploit the flexibility of mapping virtual pages to physical pages, and propose a page allocation algorithm that considers both segment information and conflict misses in DRAM to distribute heavily written pages across different DRAM sets. Trace-driven experiments confirm the effectiveness of proposed technique in reducing both DRAM misses and PCM writes, thus simultaneously improving performance and lifetime of DRAM-PCM hybrid main memory. © 2015 IEEE."
102,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Enhanced LCCG: A novel test clock generation scheme for faster-than-at-speed delay testing,"On-chip faster-than-at-speed delay testing provides a promising way for small delay defect detection. However, the frequency of on-chip generated test clock would be impacted by process variations. Hence, it requires determining the actual frequency of generated test clock to ensure the effectiveness of faster-than-at-speed delay testing. In this paper, we present a novel test clock generation scheme, namely Enhanced LCCG, for faster-than-at-speed delay testing. In the proposed scheme, faster-than-at-speed test clock is firstly generated by configuring the corresponding control information specified in the test pattern into Enhanced LCCG. Then, by constructing oscillation paths and counting the corresponding oscillation iteration numbers, the actual frequency of test clock can be measured and calculated with high resolution. Experimental results are presented to validate the proposed method. © 2015 IEEE."
103,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,An efficient 3D-IC on-chip test framework to embed TSV testing in memory BIST,"TSV-based 3D-IC design can reduce the connection length of stacked ICs and enhance I/O bandwidth of heterogeneous integrated circuits. However the testing of 3D ICs is more complicated than that of 2D ICs. This paper presents an efficient on-chip 3D-IC test framework that can embed the test procedure of TSVs into the memory BIST process. By using the same test patterns generated from the memory BIST mechanism, the faults in both memories and TSVs can be detected simultaneously without extra time to test TSVs. The area overhead for on-chip testing can also be reduced significantly. Experimental results show that the proposed test framework can gain a good performance in test time reduction with very low area overhead penalty for a memory-logic stacked IC. © 2015 IEEE."
104,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,An integrated temperature-cycling acceleration and test technique for 3D stacked ICs,"In a modern 3D IC, electrical connections between vertically stacked dies are made using through silicon vias. Through silicon vias are subject to undesirable early-life effects such as protrusion as well as void formation and growth. These effects result in opens, resistive opens, and stress induced carrier mobility reduction, and consequently circuit failures. Operating the ICs under extreme temperature cycling can effectively accelerate such early-life failures and make them detectable at the manufacturing test process. An integrated temperature-cycling acceleration and test technique is introduced in this paper that integrates a temperature-cycling acceleration procedure with pre-, mid-, and post-bond tests for 3D ICs. Moreover, it reduces the need for costly temperature chamber based temperature-cycling acceleration procedures. All these result in a reduction in the overall test costs. The proposed method is a schedule-based solution that creates the required temperature cycling effect along with performing the tests. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency. © 2015 IEEE."
105,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Software-based test and diagnosis of SoCs using embedded and wide-I/O DRAM,"Modern CMOS technology enables the integration of billions of transistors on a single chip. Emerging three-dimensional (3D) stacking techniques using through-silicon vias (TSVs) promise even higher integration by combining multiple dies in a single package. In order to keep the test cost low and enhance field reliability, there is a need to re-think conventional test practices, such as test-data compression and online testing, as well as test-application techniques and fault diagnosis. Traditional hardware-based on-chip decompression solutions are limited to compression techniques that do not require large hardware overhead for decompression. However, today's system-on-chip designs (SoCs) offer resources, such as embedded processors and large amounts of fast embedded memories, that can be exploited for efficient on-chip test application, online testing, and diagnosis using software-based compression. Examples of such systems are 3D ICs with wide-I/O DRAM or traditional ICs with embedded DRAM (eDRAM). We propose a test and diagnosis solution that makes use of software-based decompression of deterministic scan-test pattern and allows for test application from on-chip DRAM to the logic die, extending traditional hardware-based methods and allowing for online scan-based test and diagnosis. This solution therefore targets SoCs that contain, in addition to a microprocessor, multiple digital-logic cores and glue logic, all of which need to be tested using scan test patterns. Simulation results for benchmarks show that we can achieve high test-data compression, comparable with what is obtained using commercial tools, as well as high-resolution on-chip diagnosis with negligible hardware and test-time overhead. © 2015 IEEE."

By leveraging logic-DRAM co-design, this paper exploits the cost efficient approach to repair 3D integration induced defective cells in stacked DRAM with unused spares. In particular, we propose to make the DRAM array open its redundancy to off-chip access by small architecture modification, and further design the defective address comparison and redundant address remapping with very efficient architecture on logic die to achieve the equivalent memory repair. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed repair technique for DRAM after die stacking is able to significantly alleviate the yield loss, with very low area and power consumption overhead and negligible timing penalty. © 2015 IEEE."
107,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Electromigration-aware redundant via insertion,"As the feature size shrinks, electromigration (EM) becomes a more critical reliability issue in IC design. EM around the via structures accounts for much of the reliability problems in ICs, and the insertion of redundant vias can mitigate the adverse effect of EM by reducing current density. In this paper, we model EM reliability of redundant via structures, considering current distribution with different via layouts. Based on our EM model, we choose redundant via layouts that can increase the EM-related lifetime by using integer linear programming (ILP). To overcome the runtime issue of ILP, we also propose speed-up techniques for our EM-aware redundant via insertion. Experimental results show that our scheme brings much more EM-robustness to circuits with the similar number of redundant vias, compared to the conventional redundant via insertion techniques. © 2015 IEEE."

Synthesis from guarded atomic actions has been investigated by Arvind et al. to explore non-determinism for hardware concurrency. We show in this work that non-determinism in the guarded atomic actions can be further explored for synthesis of resilient circuits. When an error happens in an atomic action, the action may not need to be recomputed if there exist other feasible actions. Such flexibilities will be increased in the specification and explored in the synthesis for efficient error resiliency. Our synthesis approach expands the solution space and offers the possibility of performance optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our synthesis approach. © 2015 IEEE."
109,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Incremental Latin hypercube sampling for lifetime stochastic behavioral modeling of analog circuits,"In advanced technology node, not only process variations but also aging effects have critical impacts on circuit performance. Most of existing works consider process variations and aging effects separately while building the corresponding behavior models. Because of the time-varied circuit property, parametric yield need to be reanalyzed in each aging time step. This results in expensive simulation cost for reliability analysis due to the huge number of circuit simulation runs. In this paper, an incremental Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) approach is proposed to build the stochastic behavior models for analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits while simultaneously considering process variations and aging effects. By reusing previous sampling information, only a few new samples are incrementally updated to build an accurate stochastic model in different time steps, which significantly reduces the number of simulations for aging analysis. Experiments on an operational amplifier and a DAC circuit achieve 242x speedup over traditional reliability analysis method with similar accuracies. © 2015 IEEE."

However, the elimination of the access-transistor introduces several parasitic effects due to the existence of partially-selected devices during memory accesses, which could limit the scalability of access-transistor-free (ATF) memristive crossbars.

However, the major challenge to make ReRAM work in a 3D crossbar array is the integration of a selector device with a ReRAM device.

Here, we report a Field Assisted Superlinear Threshold (FASTTM) Selector technology that overcomes the sneak path barrier with a selectivity ratio of 10E10. The switching and recover speed, on/off ratio, switching slope, program, erase, and read endurance, and variability of the FASTTM selector will be discussed.

To enable device-circuit-system co-design and optimization, a SPICE model of ReRAM that can reproduce the device characteristics in circuit simulations is needed. In this paper, we present a novel tool for ReRAM design including a physics-based SPICE model, the model parameters extraction strategy, as well as the system assessment method. This physics-based SPICE model can capture all the essential features of HfO x -based ReRAM including the DC/AC and multi-level switching behaviors, switching reliability, and intrinsic device variations. A strategy is developed to extract the critical model parameters from the fabricated ReRAM devices. A variety of electrical measurements on various ReRAMs are performed to verify and calibrate the model. The assessment method based on the experimentally verified SPICE model can be applied to explore a wide range of applications including: 1) variation-aware and reliability-emphasized system design; 2) system performance evaluation; 3) array architecture optimization.

However, in a modern hardware-accelerated environment, coverage may be analyzed across a simulator and an emulator. Hence, neither conventional coverage techniques performed in simulation nor hardware coverage monitors embedded in an emulator can be directly applied. To resolve the above problem, we propose using coverage assertions to detect coverage events across a simulator and an emulator. In addition, an Assertion Operation Graph and graph-based algorithms are proposed to minimize the hardware and performance overheads of coverage assertions. We perform experiments in the hardware-accelerated environment of Xilinx ISE and show an encouraging reduction of coverage assertion overheads. © 2015 IEEE."
118,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,SWAT: Assertion-based debugging of concurrency issues at system level,"Modern multi- and many-core systems are prone to concurrency-related bugs that surface only at system level. Detecting these bugs might require dealing with low-level hardware (HW) protocols and/or software (SW) inter-task interactions. Virtual platforms (VPs) offer a vehicle to conveniently debug HW/SW functionality, yet developers are mostly limited to manually breakpoint, step and interact with the system. To ease debugging during integration at system level, this paper introduces SWAT, an assertion-based debugging framework that checks and correlates system-wide interactions among HW and SW components. SWAT is used together with VPs to enable detecting HW/SW concurrency bugs with lower effort than traditional manual techniques.

Efficient fault tolerant solutions capable of combining the advantages of static optimization and runtime adaptation are needed. To achieve this goal, we propose a static reliability-aware scheduling technique, aiming to guide runtime adaptation and relieve most of the computational overhead. The proposed static scheduler considers 'reliability level' (RL) as an intermediate scheduling dimension and creates a 'task-to-RL-to-core' mapping. This enables the 'RL-to-core' mapping to be efficiently adapted at runtime according to fault rate variations, while the 'task-to-RL' mapping can still be reused. Experimental studies show that by considering fault rates during static scheduling, runtime application execution time can be improved by up to 19% in a non-constant fault rate environment. © 2015 IEEE."
121,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Approximation-aware scheduling on heterogeneous multi-core architectures,"The high performance demand of embedded systems along with restrictive thermal design power (TDP) constraint have lead to the emergence of the heterogenous multi-core architectures, where cores with the same instruction-set architecture but different power-performance characteristics provide new opportunities for energy-efficient computing. Heterogeneity introduces challenges in scheduling the tasks to the appropriate cores and selecting the frequency assignment of each core. In this paper, we introduce an approximation-aware scheduling framework for soft real-time tasks on the heterogeneous multi-core architectures. We consider multiple versions of a task obtained by introducing approximation in the computation to provide different levels of quality of service (QoS) versus performance tradeoffs. The additional choice of approximation allows us more flexibility in meeting the performance and TDP constraints while maximizing QoS per unit of energy. © 2015 IEEE."
122,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Composing real-time applications from communicating black-box components,"To handle complexity, embedded software is usually divided into components that are developed independently from each other and then need to be integrated in a reliable and deterministic manner. This involves buffering and synchronizing exchanged signals, as well as finding a feasible execution schedule, which is a tedious and error-prone procedure. We propose a model of computation that enables a programming framework which automatically performs such an integration, without requiring access to the components' source code. The developer only needs to declare interface signals between the components, connect them and define their execution periods. A software library then synthesizes deterministic communication mechanisms and provides a flexible, yet safe interface for time-triggered execution. Our approach does not require any run-time environment or special compiler, which makes it light-weight and amenable to be used on embedded platforms with limited resources. © 2015 IEEE."

When mixed-criticality systems are implemented on multicore architectures, several challenges arise such as the efficient partitioning of these systems. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting a novel mixed-criticality partitioning algorithm, the Dual-Partitioned Mixed-Criticality (DPM) algorithm, that allows limited migration of LO-criticality tasks to enhance the efficiency of the partitioning while maintaining many of the advantages of partitioned systems. Experimental results show that DPM consistently outperforms existing mixed-criticality partitioning algorithms, for example, at utilizations of 0.8 or higher, DPM is able to schedule 17% more systems. © 2015 IEEE."
124,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Reducing Dynamic Dispatch Overhead (DDO) of SLDL-synthesized embedded software,"System-Level Design Languages (SLDL) allow component-oriented specifications, e.g. for separating computation and communication. This separation allows for a flexible model composition, refinement and explorations. This flexibility, however, requires dynamic dispatch during execution that degrades the simulation performance. After synthesized to a target platform, the model re-composition is no longer required. Then, the involved Dynamic Dispatch Overhead (DDO) only limits performance without providing benefits. Thus, approaches are needed for software synthesis to analyze model connectivity and eliminate the DDO wherever possible. This paper introduces a static dispatch type analysis as part of the DDO-aware embedded C code synthesis from SLDL models. Our DDO-aware software (SW) synthesis emits faster, more readable static dispatch code whenever a static connectivity is determinable. By replacing virtual functions with direct function calls, the DDO can be totally eliminated allowing for aggressive inlining optimizations by the compiler.

125,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Contact pitch and location prediction for Directed Self-Assembly template verification,"Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) is a promising technique for contacts/vias patterning in 7 nm technology nodes. In DSA process, groups of contact holes/vias are generated by the self-assembly process guided by the 'guiding templates'. The guiding templates are patterned by conventional optical lithography process such as 193 nm immersion lithography. As a result, the patterning fidelity and variation in the template shapes is very likely to affect the final contact holes/vias. While feasible in principle, rigorous DSA process simulation is unacceptably slow for full chip verification in practice. This paper proposes a machine learning based verification that can predict the pitch size of the contact holes and the hole centers. Given a set of training data that consists of simulated template and contact hole patterns, our method is able to learn a highly accurate predictive model for pitch size and hole location. To build a statistical model for prediction, we utilize computer vision techniques to extract various geometric and image features. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the effectiveness of the proposed features, and compare several machine learning algorithms to achieve an effective and efficient prediction. The experimental results show that compared to the minutes or even hours of simulation time in rigorous methods, our best prediction model achieves very promising results (RMSE = 0.135 pitch grid) with less than one second of training and predicting runtime overhead. © 2015 IEEE."

127,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Polynomial time optimal algorithm for stencil row planning in e-beam lithography,"Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a very promising candidate for integrated circuit (IC) fabrication beyond the 10 nm technology node. To address its throughput issue, the Character Projection (CP) technique has been proposed, and its stencil planning can be optimized with aware of overlapping characters. However, the top level 2D stencil planning problem has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. As its most essential step, the 1D row ordering is believed hard as well, and no polynomial time optimal solution has been provided so far. In this paper, we propose a polynomial time optimal algorithm to solve the row ordering problem, which serves as the major subroutine for the entire stencil planning problem. Proof and experimental results are also provided to verify the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm. © 2015 IEEE."
128,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Fast mask assignment using positive semidefinite relaxation in LELECUT triple patterning lithography,"One of the most promising techniques in the 14 nm logic node and beyond is triple patterning lithography (TPL). Recently, LELECUT type TPL technology, where the third mask is used to cut the patterns, is discussed to alleviate native conflict and overlay problems in LELELE type TPL. In this paper, we formulate LELECUT mask assignment problem which maximizes the compliance to the lithography and apply a positive semidefinite relaxation. In our proposed method, the positive semidefinite relaxation is defined by extracting cut candidates from the layout, and a mask assignment is obtained from an optimum solution of the relaxation by randomized rounding technique. © 2015 IEEE."
129,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Layout decomposition for Spacer-is-Metal (SIM) self-aligned double patterning,"Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) has become a preferred double patterning technology, due to its better overlay controllability. Two types of layout decomposition schemes are used to define two-dimensional layout patterns in SADP: Spacer-is-Metal (SIM) and Spacer-is-Dielectric (SID), and SIM-type layout decomposition typically has higher decomposition flexibility (especially for gridless designs). While SID-type layout decomposition has been studied extensively, however, only one previous work extended a satisfiability-based SID-type decomposer to SIM-type layout decomposition; this SAT-based method is inefficient for large-scale designs and not applicable to non-decomposable layouts. This paper introduces an efficient graph-based SIM-type layout decomposition heuristic. The decomposition problem is first transformed into a constrained set-covering problem. Then, an efficient algorithm composed of a greedy heuristic followed by a partition-based solution refinement scheme is proposed to simultaneously minimize the conflicts on both core masks and cut masks. Experimental results show that the algorithm can efficiently derive a good decomposition solution with minimized pattern conflicts. © 2015 IEEE."

134,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,An accurate ACOSSO metamodeling technique for processor architecture design space exploration,"Processor architects usually design uniprocessor or chip multiprocessor (CMP) by using a platform-based approach. One of the major challenges in this approach is to explore the exponential-size design space composed of many tunable and interacting architectural parameters. An exhaustive search of the design space is prohibitive because of the expensive run-time of simulations. So an efficient design space exploration (DSE) strategy that can fast find the multi-objective architectural configurations (points in design space) in terms of system metrics like performance and energy is needed. In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient adaptive component selection and smoothing operator (ACOSSO) metamodel assisted NSGA-II (MA-NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique for processor DSE. We show the effectiveness of our methodology by comparing with linear regression (LR), restrict cubic splines (RCS), natural cubic splines (NCS) and artificial neural network (ANN) metamodeling techniques for processor design metrics prediction and architecture optimization. The experimental results show that, the proposed methodology achieves higher prediction accuracy and better architecture optimization results. © 2015 IEEE."
135,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Speeding up single pass simulation of PLRUt caches,"CPU caches have become an essential component in many computer systems as they can significantly increase system performance by alleviating the effects of memory latency. For many designers part of the system design flow is the selection of an appropriately configured cache, a task which can be performed using cache simulators. Exploring the entire design space through precise cache simulation is a lengthy process, and while certain cache replacement policies have been optimised for fast simulation execution (such as LRU and FIFO), no effective optimisations have been proposed for an extremely effective replacement policy: Pseudo Least Recently Used tree-based, also known as PLRUt. In this paper we are the first to present a number of characteristics of the PLRUt replacement policy that lend themselves to the design of an optimised hash table-based cache simulator. We demonstrate that our optimised simulator is up to 1.93x faster than an un-optimised implementation. © 2015 IEEE."
136,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,ADAPT: An adaptive manycore methodology for software pipelined applications,"Future on-chip manycore systems are expected to have hundreds of cores, and to be used for a number of applications to amortize their fabrication costs. In this paper, we examine how software pipelines, which are useful for streaming/multimedia applications, can be efficiently executed on a manycore system with shared memory. The goal is to balance the stages of the pipeline under workload and resource variations. This paper presents ADAPT, a method to quickly detect bottleneck stages and add cores (workers) to those bottleneck stages at run-time. Further, if there are no idle workers, then a shuffling of workers across stages is performed to improve/maintain throughput. ADAPT is implemented in a 48-core system which is built using a commercial core and tool suite. For a variety of applications, ADAPT takes less than 2 μs for one run-time adaptation, and achieves up to 2.1× the throughput of a state-of-the-art method (which is modified and implemented in the same system for a fair comparison). These results illustrate the applicability of ADAPT for fine-grained run-time management of manycore systems to achieve high throughput for software pipelines. © 2015 IEEE."

Among the relevant existing solutions the well-known gem5 simulator provides a rich architecture description framework. However, these features come at the price of prohibitive simulation time that limits the scope of possible explorations to configurations made of tens of cores. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel trace-driven simulation approach for efficient exploration of manycore architectures. © 2015 IEEE."
138,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Compact modeling of microbatteries using behavioral linearization and model-order reduction,"Thin-film, solid-state microbatteries represent now a viable alternative for powering small form-factor microsystems or storing the power harvested by energy microsensors. One major obstacle to their widespread use in integrated systems has been the absence of a high-fidelity, physics-based, compact model describing their operation and enabling their design and verification in the same CAD environment as integrated systems or energy harvesters. In this work, we develop and validate such a model using a thorough analysis of the electrochemistry of a thin-film, solid-state lithium-ion microbattery. Our compact model is based on a behavioral linearisation step where the nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the microbattery electrochemistry are replaced with linear ones without virtually any loss in accuracy. Unlike Taylor series and other local techniques, our behavioral linearisation is global and is based on the careful examinations and validation of global electroneutrality in the thin-film, solid-state electrolyte. We then apply the well-established methodology of Arnoldi-based model-order reduction (MOR) techniques to develop a compact microbattery model capable of reproducing its input(current)-output(voltage) electrical behavior with less than 1% error with respect to the full discretised PDEs. The use of the reduced-order model results in more than 30X speedup in transient simulation. © 2015 IEEE."
139,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,GPU-accelerated parallel Monte Carlo analysis of analog circuits by hierarchical graph-based solver,"In this article, we propose a new parallel matrix solver, which is very amenable for Graphic Process Unit (GPU) based fine-grain massively-threaded parallel computing. The new method is based on the graph-based symbolic analysis technique to generate the computing sequence of determinants in terms of determinant decision diagrams (DDDs). DDD represents very simple data dependence and data parallelism, which can be explored much easier by GPU massively-threaded parallel computing than existing LU-based methods. The new method is based on the hierarchical determinant decision diagrams (HDDDs). Inspired by the inherent data parallelism and simple data dependence in the evaluation process of HDDD, we design GPU-amenable continuous data structures to enable fast memory access and evaluation of massive parallel threads. In addition to parallelism in DDD graph, the new algorithm can naturally explore data independence existing in Monte Carlo and frequency domain analysis. The resulting algorithm is a general-purpose matrix solver suitable for fine-grain massive GPU-based computing for any circuit matrices. Experimental results show that the new evaluation algorithm can achieve about two orders of magnitude speedup over the serial CPU based evaluation and more than 4× speedup over numerical SPICE-based simulation method on some large analog circuits. © 2015 IEEE."
140,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Automated generation of hybrid system models for reachability analysis of nonlinear analog circuits,"We address the problem of formally verifying nonlinear analog circuits with an uncertain initial set by computing their reachable set. A reachable set contains the union of all possible system trajectories for a set of uncertain states and as such can be used to provably check whether undesired behavior is possible or not. Our method is based on local linearizations of the nonlinear circuit, which naturally results in a piecewise-linear system. To substantially limit the number of required locations, our approach computes linearized locations on-the-fly depending on which states are reachable. We can show that without the proposed on-the-fly technique, the conversion to piecewise-linear systems is infeasible even for a few nonlinear semiconductor devices (discrete state-space explosion problem). Our method is fully automatic and only requires a circuit netlist. Piecewise-linear systems have gained popularity not only for verification, but also for accelerated simulation of nonlinear circuits. Our method provides a guaranteed bound on the number of linearization locations that have to be explicitly computed for such a nonlinear circuit. © 2015 IEEE."

The proposed method selects multiple sets of sensitivity configurations, obtains multiple estimates and computes the average of them for accuracy improvement exploiting an averaging effect. Experimental results with a 32-nm predictive technology model show that the proposed method can reduce the estimation error by 49% or reduce the sensor area by 75% while keeping the accuracy. © 2015 IEEE."
142,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,On test syndrome merging for reasoning-based board-level functional fault diagnosis,"Machine learning algorithms are advocated for automated diagnosis of board-level functional failures due to the extreme complexity of the problem. Such reasoning-based solutions, however, remain ineffective at the early stage of the product cycle, simply because there are insufficient historical data for training the diagnostic system that has a large number of test syndromes. In this paper, we present a novel test syndrome merging methodology to tackle this problem. That is, by leveraging the domain knowledge of the diagnostic tests and the board structural information, we adaptively reduce the feature size of the diagnostic system by selectively merging test syndromes such that it can effectively utilize the available training cases. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2015 IEEE."
143,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Event-driven transient error propagation: A scalable and accurate soft error rate estimation approach,"Fast and accurate soft error vulnerability assessment is an integral part of cost-effective robust system design. The de facto approach is expensive fault simulation or emulation in which the error is injected in random bits and cycles, and then the effect is simulated for millions of cycles. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative approach to obtain the soft error vulnerability by integrating transient error propagation in an event-driven gate-level logic simulator which captures the combined effect of various masking factors. By carefully combining various generated errors at different cycles, in one pass all the error generation and propagation effects across all bits and all cycles are analyzed. This enables us to drastically reduce the runtime while maintaining the accuracy compared to statistical fault injection. © 2015 IEEE."

We then propose for the first time a standard side-channel measurement setup using OCM. Finally, we provide some key ideas on methodology to integrate the validation of hardware security and trust in the standard testing flow, exploiting OCM. © 2015 IEEE."
145,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Hardware Trojan detection using exhaustive testing of k-bit subspaces,"Post-silicon hardware Trojan detection is challenging because the attacker only needs to implement one of many possible design modifications, while the verification effort must guarantee the absence of all imaginable malicious circuitry. Existing test generation strategies for Trojan detection use controllability and observability metrics to limit the modifications targeted. However, for cryptographic hardware, the n plaintext bits are ideal for an attacker to use in Trojan triggering because the size of n prohibits exhaustive testing, and all n bits have identical controllability, making it impossible to bias testing using existing methods. Our detection method addresses this difficult case by observing that an attacker can realistically only afford to use a small subset, k, of all n possible signals for triggering. By aiming to exhaustively cover all possible k subsets of signals, we guarantee detection of Trojans using less than k plaintext bits in the trigger. We provide suggestions on how to determine k, and validate our approach using an AES design. © 2015 IEEE."
146,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,AROMA: A highly accurate microcomponent-based approach for embedded processor power analysis,"We propose a new embedded processor power analysis approach that maps instruction executions to microarchitecture components for highly efficient and accurate power evaluations, which are crucial for embedded system designs. We observe that in practice, the execution of each high-level instruction in a processor always triggers the same microcomponent activity sequence while the difference of power consumption values of different instructions is mainly due to timing variations caused by hazards and cache misses. Hence, by incorporating accurately pre-characterized microcomponent power consumption values into an efficient instruction-microcomponent processor timing simulation tool, we construct a highly accurate embedded processor power analysis tool. Additionally, based on the proposed approach, we accurately and effortlessly capture the power waveform at any time point for power profiling, peak power and dynamic thermal distribution analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is nearly as accurate as gate-level simulators, with an error rate of less than 1.2% while achieving simulation speeds of up to 20 MIPS, five orders faster than a commercial gate-level simulator. © 2015 IEEE."

Since loop nests are usually mapped onto CGRA for acceleration, optimizing the mapping is an important goal for design of CGRAs. Moreover, how to reduce energy consumption also becomes one of primary concerns in using CGRAs. This paper makes three contributions: a) Proposing an energy consumption model for CGRA; b) Formulating loop nests mapping problem to minimize the battery charge loss; c) Extract an efficient heuristic algorithm called BPMap. Experiment results show that our methods improve the performance of the kernels and lower the energy consumption. © 2015 IEEE."

This paper proposes a holistic thermal management that applies dynamic voltage/frequency scaling to cores and routers together to maximize system performance under temperature constraint. The proposed method first determines a power budget given in aggregate weighted power for every pillar of vertically adjacent tiles. Then it performs voltage/frequency assignment under the budget while exploiting the characteristics of the applications. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods. © 2015 IEEE."

This work proposes a model abstraction approach for real-time power estimation in the manner of machine learning. The singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is exploited to abstract the principle components of relationship between register toggling profile and accurate power waveform. The abstracted power model is automatically instrumented to RTL implementation and synthesized into FPGA platform for real-time power estimation by instrumenting the register toggling profile. The prototype implementation on three IP cores predicts the cycle-by-cycle power dissipation within 5% accuracy loss compared with a commercial power estimation tool. © 2015 IEEE."
150,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Heterogeneous architecture design with emerging 3D and non-volatile memory technologies,"Energy becomes the primary concern in nowadays multi-core architecture designs. Moore's law predicts that the exponentially increasing number of cores can be packed into a single chip every two years, however, the increasing power density is the obstacle to continuous performance gains. Recent studies show that heterogeneous multi-core is a competitive promising solution to optimize performance per watt. In this paper, different types of heterogeneous architecture are discussed. For each type, current challenges and latest solutions are briefly introduced. Preliminary analyses are performed to illustrate the scalability of the heterogeneous system and the potential benefits towards future application requirements. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of leveraging three-dimensional (3D) integration on heterogeneous architectures.

151,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,Alleviate chip I/O pin constraints for multicore processors through optical interconnects,"Chip I/O pins are an increasingly limited resource and significantly affect the performance, power and cost of multicore processors. Optical interconnects promise low power and high bandwidth, and are potential alternatives to electrical interconnects. This work systematically developed a set of analytical models for electrical and optical interconnects to study their structures, receiver sensitivities, crosstalk noises, and attenuations. We verified the models by published implementation results. The analytical models quantitatively identified the advantages of optical interconnects in terms of bandwidth, energy consumption, and transmission distance. We showed that optical interconnects can significantly reduce chip pin counts. For example, compared to electrical interconnects, optical interconnects can save at least 92% signal pins when connecting chips more than 25 cm (10 inches) apart. © 2015 IEEE."
152,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,A fast and accurate network-on-chip timing simulator with a flit propagation model,"Network-on-chip (NoC) can be a simulation bottleneck in a many-core system. Traditional cycle-accurate NoC simulators need a long simulation time, as they synchronize all components (routers and FIFOs) every cycle to guarantee the exact behaviors. Also, a NoC simulation does not benefit from transaction-level modeling (TLM) in speed without any accuracy loss, because the transaction timings of a simulated packet depend on other packets due to wormhole switching. In this paper, we propose a novel NoC simulation method which can calculate cycle-accurate timings with wormhole switching. Instead of updating states of routers and FIFOs cycle-by-cycle, we use a pre-built model to calculate a flit's exact times at ports of routers in a NoC. The results of the proposed simulator are verified with NoC implementations (cycle-accurate at RTL) created by a commercial NoC compiler. All timing results match perfectly with packet waveforms generated by above NoCs (with 40-325 times speed up). As another comparison, the speed of the simulator is similar or faster (0.5-23X) than a TG2 NoC model, which is a SystemC and transaction-level model without timing accuracy (due to ignoring wormhole traffics). © 2015 IEEE."

However, most existing techniques for detecting malware utilize software-based methods that incur significant performance overheads that are often not feasible in embedded systems.

156,ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,2015,IC Piracy prevention via Design Withholding and Entanglement,"Globalization of the semiconductor industry has raised serious concerns about trustworthy hardware. Particularly, an untrusted manufacturer can steal the information of a design (Reverse Engineering), and/or produce extra chips illegally (IC Piracy). Among many candidates that address these attacks, Design Withholding techniques work by replacing a part of the design with a reconfigurable block on chip, so that none of the manufactured chips will function properly until they are activated in a trusted facility, where the withheld function is restored back into the reconfigurable block on chip. However, most existing approaches are ad-hoc based, and are facing two major challenges: 1) susceptibility to a category of algorithmic attacks, from attackers in a strong position, such as a manufacturer; and 2) scaling up the defense level is checkmated by the explosion of hardware cost that has to be paid at the designer's side. In this paper, we propose a novel protection scheme, called Entanglement, which can substantially strengthen the Design Withholding framework: 1) the algorithmic attacks are prevented by forcing the attacker to solve a huge number of problems of high computational complexity; 2) the attack cost (in terms of computational complexity) is quantitatively controllable at the designer's end, with low hardware overhead: while the cost of attack can be increased exponentially, the hardware overhead imposed on the designer's side grows only linearly. The proposed work distinguishes itself from the previous works by not relying on the difficulty of finding the solution for some NP-Complete/NP-Hard problems, but rather, on the exponentially boosted number of such problems that an attacker has to solve, while carefully maintaining the growth of the hardware overhead to be scalable via Entanglement. © 2015 IEEE."

We also present approximate solutions for the calculation of the proposed metrics to reduce computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation metric is both effective and efficient. © 2015 IEEE."
